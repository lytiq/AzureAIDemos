 39 | 
 40 | Hello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One are investments in the AI, including how it's helping Search; two, subscriptions, which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up five times since 2019.
 41 | 
 42 | Subscriptions is growing strongly, powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV, and Google One. Three, Cloud, which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth, driven by our gen AI and product leadership; and four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.
 43 | 
 44 | Last year brought new excitement around gen AI, and I'm proud of how we responded responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code in a natively multi-modal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers.
 45 | 
 46 | Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities, and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products.
 47 | 
 48 | Let's start with Search. We are already experimenting with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience, or SGE, faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE.
 49 | 
 50 | It's available through Search Labs in seven languages. By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions, like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding, such as education or even gift ideas.
 51 | 
 52 | We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps.
 53 | 
 54 | It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 series. And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers that includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of search campaigns.
 55 | 
 56 | Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements Search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro, and it's much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding, and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra.
 57 | 
 58 | That's a good segue way to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum.
 59 | 
 60 | They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, MultiView, and unlimited DVR.
 61 | 
 62 | NFL Sunday Ticket has found its perfect home on YouTube, and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products, and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers.
 63 | 
 64 | From here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud, throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad gen AI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform, and our new Duet AI agents. In Q4, our product and gen AI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands, including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility, and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI Hyper computer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs AI, software, and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.
 65 | 
 66 | Customers like Anthropic, Character.AI, Essential AI, and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it. For developers building gen AI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment, and deploy over 130 gen AI models, including PaLM, Med-PaLM, Sec-PaLM, and Gemini, as well as popular open-source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with API requests increasing nearly six times from H1 to H2 last year.
 67 | 
 68 | Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals; and Victoria's Secret & Co. will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI Search and Conversations. Customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, to boost productivity and improve their operations.
 69 | 
 70 | Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber, and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duet AI assists software developers and cybersecurity analysts.
 71 | 
 72 | Duet AI for developers is the only gen AI offering to support the complete development and operations lifecycle, fine-tuned with a customer's own code corpus and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances, and Commerzbank write better software faster with AI code completion, code generation, and chat support. With Duet AI in security operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify, and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels.
 73 | 
 74 | With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of causal deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud gen AI-enabled consultants, and Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint Generative AI Center of Excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube, and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure.
 75 | 
 76 | This infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company.
 77 | 
 78 | You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit, and other teams into a new functional structure.
 79 | 
 80 | This will help us pool resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio. Across different teams, we have wound down some nonpriority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings.
 81 | 
 82 | That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded phone of the year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come.
 83 | 
 84 | In our other bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips; and Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together, from our partners across the Android ecosystem who were on display at CES; to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses, and advertising partners; to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more.
 85 | 
 86 | I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philipp?
 87 | 
 88 | Philipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer
 89 | 
 90 | Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year on year. In Google Advertising, search and other revenues grew 13% year on year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year.
 91 | 
 92 | YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year on year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand; and network revenues declined 2% year on year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which was previously named Google other, year-on-year revenues increased 23%, driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment.
 93 | 
 94 | From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about demand gen momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant, visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail, and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over 3 billion users as they stream, scroll, connect, and decide what to buy.
 95 | 
 96 | Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads in Discovery campaigns. As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better-performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ad's context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4.
 97 | 
 98 | In addition to now being available in eight languages. more advanced gen AI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power a new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open in beta to U.S.
 99 | 
100 | and U.K. advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes.
101 | 
102 | As we shared last quarter, ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience and will continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter, retail was a highlight.
103 | 
104 | We continue to see a stronger start to the season, up to and including Cyber Five. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to two times the deals in the U.S. versus last season, as well as a better shopping experience.
105 | 
106 | Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination; new filters, like get it fast; and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S.
107 | 
108 | big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in-store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber Five; and a well-known global fashion brand who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads. Moving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before: YouTube success starts with creator success.
109 | 
110 | We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators mean more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across four pillars: creation, viewers, monetization, and responsibility.
111 | 
112 | First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. Gen AI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget.
113 | 
114 | We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to allowed for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and Connected TV.
115 | 
116 | Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs, or what we refer to as the living room, is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket, and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels.
117 | 
118 | Put this all together, and YouTube is the must-have app on every Connected TV. Monetization is pillar number three and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second non-skippable ads and pause experiences, as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads.
119 | 
120 | For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely.
121 | 
122 | Our AI part video format from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip.
123 | 
124 | YouTube Music and Premium performed well. Premium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles, and other enhancements.
125 | 
126 | We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including MultiView, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here.
127 | 
128 | Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. We just talked about the NFL.
129 | 
130 | Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024.
131 | 
132 | I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year.Ruth, over to you.
133 | 
134 | Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer
135 | 
136 | Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full-year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.
137 | 
138 | My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year, as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023.
139 | 
140 | In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and opex based on associated headcount. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%.
141 | 
142 | Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities.
143 | 
144 | Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16%, driven by both direct response and brand advertising.
145 | 
146 | Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. Subscriptions, platforms. and devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%.
147 | 
148 | Google Services operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI.
149 | 
150 | Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our other bets, for the full-year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion, and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the other bets.
151 | 
152 | Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base.
153 | 
154 | Second, within subscriptions, platforms, and devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full-year 2023, driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One. Play had solid growth again in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In Devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio.
155 | 
156 | Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full-year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement.
157 | 
158 | The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area. In terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities.
159 | 
160 | Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our headcount down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent.
161 | 
162 | Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to capex, our reported capex in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in capex in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in capex will be notably larger than in 2023.
163 | 
164 | With regard to other bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.

169 | [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
170 | 
171 | Brian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
172 | 
173 | Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Philipp. Philipp, the first one is about sort of a lot of the new generative AI advertising tools.
174 | 
175 | You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've been talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers. The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? And then secondly, how do you think about the long-term sales force intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax impacting the overall ad allocation? Thanks.
176 | 
177 | Philipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer
178 | 
179 | Yeah. Thank you so much. So I've covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time.
180 | 
181 | And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: bidding, targeting, creative, as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences. We are seeing in core search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding as a very significant one on the targeting side, the broad match on creative, responsive search ads automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we're seeing in those areas. I think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that one.
182 | 
183 | You asked about hurdles and gating factors. The AI essentials play neutral in this, trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we're very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we're expecting here.
184 | 
185 | On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have two large different teams. One is our LCS, Large Customer Solutions, team that's really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions, team, which is the channel where really every customer starts from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs.
186 | 
187 | The GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it's also our fastest-growing channel, and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side. But I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there's always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers.
188 | 
189 | We're not restructuring because AI is taking away roles that's important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale, and that's why we're doing some of those adjustments. So I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here.

197 | Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
198 | 
199 | Doug Anmuth -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
200 | 
201 | Thanks for taking the questions. One for Ruth and one for Philipp. Ruth, you're now into year two of durably reengineering your cost structure. Can you just help us assess your progress so far? And are there any guideposts that we should be thinking about going forward? And then, Philipp, can you talk more about NFL Sunday Ticket and just what your key learnings were in year one? How are you thinking about the returns on the investment on both from an advertising perspective and then also subscribers to both Sunday Ticket and YouTube TV?
202 | 
203 | Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer
204 | 
205 | Thanks for the question. So we are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make, and we are very committed to the framework to durably reengineer our cost base really as we're investing to support the growth priorities. I tried to call out a number of them in opening comments, but really, as you're looking at the work being done across Google, across Alphabet, it does start with product and process prioritization to make sure we've got the right resources behind the most important opportunities, and then that creates the opportunity for reallocating resources where we can. Then we talked a lot about this quarter about organizational efficiency and structure, and we're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity.
206 | 
207 | The combination of those two, product prioritization and organizational design work, has resulted in the slower pace of hiring. You can see that in our headcount numbers down year-on-year. You can see it in some of the -- in the results that we delivered in the fourth quarter. You can -- and it also goes to the announcements around first quarter and much lower pace of hiring.
208 | 
209 | At this point in the quarter, we do estimate that severance-related expense will be roughly $700 million in the first quarter as we've continued these efforts. But as I said in opening comments, we will continue to invest in top engineering. So that's sort of the big one, if you start with product prioritization and organizational design, which is why also the note about the severance-related expense, which helps pave the way as we're continuing to do the work that we're doing. But then we have a host of other work streams, which I talked about, everything with improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, which is a very large ongoing effort; streamlining operations across Alphabet through use of AI; all the work we're doing with our suppliers and vendors; the work we're doing optimizing our real estate portfolio.
210 | 
211 | So when we've described durably reengineering, it's about continuing to build on work that started, and that is ongoing.
212 | 
213 | Philipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer
214 | 
215 | So on the NFL Sunday Ticket side, look, as I said earlier, NFL Sunday Ticket supports our long-term strategy and really help solidify YouTube's position as a must-have app on everyone's TV set. You asked about some of the learnings. Maybe I start with a viewing experience. We've received great feedback so far.
216 | 
217 | People like the navigation, MultiView, the chat, the lack of latency, a really, really positive feedback on this one. You asked about the ads and the subs. Maybe I start with the subscribers. We're pleased with the NFL Sunday Ticket sign-ups and all for a season both as part of the YouTube TV bundle and as a stand-alone offering on YouTube Primetime Channels.
218 | 
219 | Remember, you can access them via both. Nothing more to share on the subs side today on this one. On the ad side, as you know, advertisers can buy from an NFL lineup as part of our YouTube Select portfolio. And this actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content independently of whether you're doing live game on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels or watching NFL highlights, postgame commentary on YouTube channels.
220 | 
221 | And we saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here. We're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season. And I mentioned over 90 upfront and scatter advertisers partnered with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game opportunities, which we really appreciate.

229 | Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
230 | 
231 | Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
232 | 
233 | Thank you for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Sundar, a bigger-picture question, coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a world of Search Generative Experience and Bard and what that might mean for elements of commercial and non-commercial search and how use cases might change in the years ahead? And then, Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself.
234 | 
235 | It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of other bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just want to confirm whether elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that would be called out this quarter as well. Thank you.
236 | 
237 | Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer
238 | 
239 | Thanks, Eric. Great question. Look, it is an exciting time. Clearly, as I said, as we are incorporating SGE in the product, the early feedback is positive.
240 | 
241 | And we've been iterating on it, and it clearly works for certain type of queries very well. We are expanding the set of queries where it works very well. It definitely is answering a certain category of queries for the first time in a better way. So that gives us direction to proceed as well.
242 | 
243 | Overall, one of the things I think people underestimate about Search is the breadth of Search, the amount of queries we see constantly on a new day, which we haven't seen before. And so the trick here is to deliver that high-quality experience across the breadth of what we see in Search. And over time, we think Assistant will be very complementary. And we will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard, and allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow through for users even more.
244 | 
245 | So that is the -- directionally, what the opportunity set is. Obviously, a lot of execution ahead. But it's an area where I think we have a deep sense of what to do. And all the work we have taken so far, the feedback has been super positive.
246 | 
247 | Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer
248 | 
249 | And then in terms of your other question, so on the real estate charge of $1.2 billion in exit charges related to real estate, that is in Alphabet-level activities. But the other comment I was making in opening comments is when you go through the various line items, R&D, etc., you see it spread there. And we have a table and IR can walk anybody through the technicals on that just to understand how it then gets arrayed across the various lines in the P&L.

253 | Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
254 | 
255 | Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst
256 | 
257 | Thanks. I have two for Philipp, I think. Given the importance of Connected TV engagement YouTube, can you talk about the opportunity outside the U.S. for Connected TV? And what the company is doing at large to drive more adoption of YouTube or Connected TVs given the Google operating system? Anything you talk about outside the U.S.? And then you've been consistent about the strength of Shorts over the past year.
258 | 
259 | Can you talk a bit about the modernization challenges? Do you still see the headwinds that you saw at the beginning? Anything you could share about the density of the auction or advertising interest on Shorts to help us with whether or not that's still a headwind to growth? Thanks so much.
260 | 
261 | Philipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer
262 | 
263 | Yeah. Thank you so much for your question. On the Connected TV side, I mentioned it actually continues to perform really well. I said before, YouTube is the leader in U.S.
264 | 
265 | streaming watch time and it's not just one audience group diving deep. It's really all audiences. On the international side, it's something we are closely looking at. There's nothing specific I have to -- at this moment in time on this one.
266 | 
267 | On the Shorts monetization side, look, we built Shorts to respond to the huge demand from both creators and viewers for short-form video. And we're very pleased with the growth we've seen. I mentioned 2 billion-plus users every month, 70 billion in daily views. Specifically to the monetization question, Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely.
268 | 
269 | In fact, actually, since we introduced revenue sharing for Shorts, the total creator earnings generated from Shorts have increased every month, and we expect this to continue. And similar, obviously, to our long-form videos, we're really committed here to a long-term partnership. And you heard me say this before, right, when creators succeed, we succeed.

273 | Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open.
274 | 
275 | Stephen Ju -- UBS -- Analyst
276 | 
277 | OK. Thank you so much. So Philipp, this is not a new question, but it's also been about two years since PMax was launched. But it seems like there's been this long lineage of product development and rollout of things like smart bidding in your history, which I believe at the time was designed to help smaller advertisers more easily run search advertising.
278 | 
279 | And today, you're helping need to generate creative, as well as manage my spend and maximize ROI across multiple Google Services. So how are you feeling about enabling SMBs who otherwise could not advertise with you before? And what kind of TAM expansion tailwind does that create for your revenue growth over the longer term? Thanks.
280 | 
281 | Philipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer
282 | 
283 | Look, as you know, SMBs are a huge focus for us. We mentioned this several times before. They're part of our GCS channel, not only there's more in this. But they've been under a ton of change over the last few years.
284 | 
285 | And our focus has always been here on investing in solutions that really help level the playing field, and you mentioned several of those. So actually, SMBs can compete with bigger brands and more sophisticated advertisers. And so the feedback we're always getting is they need easy solutions that could drive value quickly, and several of the AI part solutions that you're mentioning are actually making the workflow and the whole on-ramp and the bidded targeting creative and so on you mentioned that is so much easier for SMBs. So we're very satisfied with what we're seeing here.
286 | 
287 | We will continue to invest. And I feel AI is really a helpful, very interesting future path to make life not only easier but also much more productive and better arise over time, more level playing field for SMBs.

291 | Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Your line is now open.
292 | 
293 | Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
294 | 
295 | Great. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Just on Search growth, I think there are some concerns on use of competitive AI tools as an alternative to Search. Just wondering if you see any changes in query volumes, positive or negative, since you've seen the year evolve and more Search innovative experiences.
296 | 
297 | And what can really make Google stand out versus other AI tools? And then Ruth, capex was $11 billion. A step up, obviously. Any one-time items in there? Or is that how we should think about the new run rate into '24? Thank you.
298 | 
299 | Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer
300 | 
301 | Thanks, Justin. First of all, look, we think about effects on Search, obviously, more broadly. People have a lot of information choices. So -- and user expectations are constantly evolving.
302 | 
303 | And so we've been doing this for a long time. And I think what ends up mattering is a strong continuous track record of innovation. Obviously, generative AI is a new tool in the arsenal. But there's a lot more that goes into Search: the breadth, the depth the diversity across verticals, stability to follow through getting actually access to rich, diverse sources of content on the web, and putting it all together in a compelling way.
304 | 
305 | And I think, through the year two, when we test, we test Search Generative Experience, particularly against everything that's out there. And we can see the progress we are making and how much users are liking the experience better. And so I think I feel very good about the progress. And our road map for '24 is strong both on the Search and the underlying AI progress, including the model.
306 | 
307 | So I'm pretty excited about what's ahead of us in '24.
308 | 
309 | Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial Officer
310 | 
311 | And with respect to capex -- the capex of $11 billion in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, was overwhelmingly investment in our technical infrastructure. To your question, there was no one-time item in there. It really reflects our outlook for everything Sundar and Philipp and I have been talking about, the extraordinary applications of AI within Google DeepMind, Google Services, Google Cloud, it's across the board, for users, for advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, governments, and it's really the long-term opportunity that offer. So last quarter, we did note that capex would continue to grow in 2024.
312 | 
313 | We do expect 2024 full-year capex to be notably larger than 2023. As a note, I think you all know this, but timing of cash payments can affect the quarterly capex number. But the main point is we're continuing to invest.

317 | Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.
318 | 
319 | Ross Sandler -- Barclays -- Analyst
320 | 
321 | Great. Thanks. So I guess a question for, I don't know if Sundar or Philipp. But if we go back to the DOJ trial that happened in the fall, there was a document that was disclosed from Google that said something along the lines of why being on ad quality team to deliver 20% RPM growth in Search is a fragile strategy.
322 | 
323 | Digging back to 2019, your business has, I think, more than doubled since then. So I guess, as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search RPM going forward? And I guess in the context of what Ruth said tonight about the large revenue base, just how do you feel about the monetization? Thank you.
324 | 
325 | Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer
326 | 
327 | Look, I think I have tremendous confidence in the quality, driven both our work, be it search quality, ads quality, our improvements on search, our improvements on ads RPM, all -- two foundational pillars are extraordinary focus on ads quality so that we deliver the actual ROI to advertisers and improve the experience for users and all underpinned by rigor and technical excellence and go-to-market excellence, right? So the fundamental attributes don't change. I think AI gives us opportunity, both on the organic side, as well as on the monetization side. And I think we are in the early days of it. I think we'll be able to, taking a long-term view, serve information needs in a deeper way.
328 | 
329 | And so I think about it in that -- with that long-term context, and I'm pretty excited about what's ahead.

334 | 
335 | Mark Mahaney -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
336 | 
337 | OK. Thanks. One question on YouTube AI and one on Cloud. On Cloud, first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter, and the nice reacceleration this quarter.
338 | 
339 | Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle, and it may be generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve to bend back up? Any commentary just on the sort of the volatility, the deceleration, and the reacceleration that we've seen? And then, Philipp, I wanted to ask on the creative side and particularly on YouTube and ads and the creative, using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google forever but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI, is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering this out into the market? And do you think that this opens up a new area of spend that wasn't there before? Thank you.
340 | 
341 | Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer
342 | 
343 | Thanks, Mark. On Cloud, let me take that. First of all, a combination of factors. I think definitely excitement around the AI solutions on top of our foundational pillar with data and analytics, infrastructure, security, etc.
344 | 
345 | But AI is definitely something which is driving interest and early adoption. And as you saw, that greater than 70% of Gen AI unions are using Google Cloud. And so I think it's an area where our strengths will continue to play out as we go through '24, especially when I look at innovation ahead from us on the AI front. And second, I think there are regional variations, but the cost optimizations in many parts are something we have mostly worked through.
346 | 
347 | And I think that was a contributing factor as well.
348 | 
349 | Philipp Schindler -- Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer
350 | 
351 | So on your YouTube question, maybe let me start with a general view. YouTube submission, you know, has enabled millions of creators around the world to share their voice and connect with audiences and obviously build thriving businesses here. And AI has been a very critical piece of this already. You are obviously aware of the made YouTube announcement where we introduced a whole lot of new complementary creativity features on YouTube, including Dream Screen, for example, and a lot of other really interesting tools and thoughts.
352 | 
353 | You can obviously imagine that we can take this more actively to the advertising world already. As you know, it continues already to power AI, a lot of our video ad solutions and measurement capabilities. It's part of video-rich campaigns. Multi-format ads are -- actually, there is a generative creator music that actually makes it easier for creators to design the perfect soundtrack already.
354 | 
355 | And as I said earlier, AI will unlock a new world of creativity. And you can see how this will -- if you just look at where models are heading, where multimodal models are heading, where the generation capabilities of those models are heading, you can absolutely see how this will impact and -- positively impact and simplify the flow for creators, similar to what you see already emerging in some of our core products like ACA on the Search side.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
  4 | 
  5 | Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thank you.
  6 | 
  7 | Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.
  8 | 
  9 | Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
 10 | 
 11 | Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
 12 | 
 13 | During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
 14 | 
 15 | Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.
 16 | 
 17 | And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sundar.
 18 | 
 19 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim. And hello, everyone.
 20 | 
 21 | It was a great quarter, led by strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud.
 22 | 
 23 | Today, I want to share how we’re thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that’s heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I’ll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond.
 24 | 
 25 | Let’s discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we’ve gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.
 26 | 
 27 | Of course, Search continues to power that, as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful, new, growing businesses.
 28 | 
 29 | Now, let’s look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make.
 30 | 
 31 | One, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity and execution; six, monetization paths.
 32 | 
 33 | First, our foundation of research leadership. We’ve been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress, for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind.
 34 | 
 35 | This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress developing Gemini and other models.
 36 | 
 37 | In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long-context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini’s native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text, code and more -- it’s highly capable.
 38 | 
 39 | We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things.
 40 | 
 41 | Beyond Gemini, we’ve built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as Imagen visual models and others.
 42 | 
 43 | Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search.
 44 | 
 45 | Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable and efficient in the world. They’ve been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency.
 46 | 
 47 | We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100 times more efficient than they were 18 months ago.
 48 | 
 49 | Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs.
 50 | 
 51 | We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures.
 52 | 
 53 | This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models, and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search.
 54 | 
 55 | AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make.
 56 | 
 57 | We have been through technology shifts before -- to the web, to mobile and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI.
 58 | 
 59 | For nearly a year, we’ve been experimenting with SGE in Search Labs across a wide range of queries. And now, we’re starting to bring AI overviews to the main search results page.
 60 | 
 61 | We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the Search experience, while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants.
 62 | 
 63 | We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It’s enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways, and to ask more complex questions.
 64 | 
 65 | Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in Search usage among people who use the new AI overviews, as well as increased user satisfaction with the results.
 66 | 
 67 | And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video, and get an AI overview with Lens.
 68 | 
 69 | Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have six products with more than two billion monthly users, including three billion Android devices. Fifteen products have half a billion users. And we operate across 100-plus countries.
 70 | 
 71 | This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences.
 72 | 
 73 | We’ve brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more.
 74 | 
 75 | We are also pleased with the progress we’re seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google App on iOS.
 76 | 
 77 | Fifth, improved velocity and execution. We’ve been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster.
 78 | 
 79 | In addition to bringing together our model building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience.
 80 | 
 81 | Earlier this year we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our Platforms and Devices teams.
 82 | 
 83 | The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems and bringing our best innovations to partners, faster.
 84 | 
 85 | We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement.
 86 | 
 87 | We continue to manage our headcount growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers and enables us to invest in the right areas.
 88 | 
 89 | Beyond our teams, we’re very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs.
 90 | 
 91 | For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs, driven by hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs.
 92 | 
 93 | We remain committed to all of this work.
 94 | 
 95 | Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud, as well as subscriptions.
 96 | 
 97 | Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max.
 98 | 
 99 | Our Cloud business continues to grow, as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world.
100 | 
101 | And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI Premium plan with Gemini Advanced.
102 | 
103 | Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail.
104 | 
105 | In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.
106 | 
107 | At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more.
108 | 
109 | Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models.
110 | 
111 | Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI startups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure.
112 | 
113 | We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPUv5p, which is now generally available, and NVIDIA’s latest generation of Blackwell GPUs.
114 | 
115 | We also announced Axion, our new Google-designed and ARM-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems.
116 | 
117 | On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers, as well as Imagen 2.0 at Cloud Next.
118 | 
119 | And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools including AI Studio and Vertex AI.
120 | 
121 | We spoke about how customers like Bristol Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems.
122 | 
123 | For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.
124 | 
125 | Customers can now also ground their gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.
126 | 
127 | In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University and Pennymac are using Gemini in Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that’s built right into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more.
128 | 
129 | We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short-video format.
130 | 
131 | And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace.
132 | 
133 | Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features.
134 | 
135 | Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security conference in February.
136 | 
137 | Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds, instead of days.
138 | 
139 | Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that, on average, viewers are watching over one billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily.
140 | 
141 | AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts.
142 | 
143 | And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trialers.
144 | 
145 | And YouTube TV now has more than eight million paid subscribers.
146 | 
147 | Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo’s fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix, with high customer satisfaction; and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles, and testing rider-only trips in Austin.
148 | 
149 | Overall it was a great quarter, and there’s more to come. I/O is in less than three weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live.
150 | 
151 | I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress, and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services, and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world.
152 | 
153 | Thank you.
154 | 
155 | Philipp.
156 | 
157 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar. And hi, everyone.
158 | 
159 | Google Services revenues of $70 billion were up 14% year-on-year.
160 | 
161 | Search and Other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the Retail vertical, with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023.
162 | 
163 | YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year.
164 | 
165 | In Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions.
166 | 
167 | Let’s now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective.
168 | 
169 | First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio -- from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types.
170 | 
171 | We’ve talked about how solutions like smart bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand. And how products like Broad Match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational.
172 | 
173 | As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We’re especially excited about the doors gen AI is opening for creative capabilities -- helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad, to the right user, in the right moment.
174 | 
175 | Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It’s helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English. And early results are encouraging.
176 | 
177 | Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with Good or Excellent Ad Strength. And those who improve their PMax Ad Strength to Excellent see 6% more conversions on average.
178 | 
179 | We’re also driving improved results for businesses opting into Automatically Created Assets, which are supercharged with gen AI. Those adopting ACA see on average 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns.
180 | 
181 | And then there’s Demand Gen. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touchpoints like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail and Discover.
182 | 
183 | Hollywood film and TV studio Lionsgate partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type would deliver the most ticketing page views for its “The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes” film. Over a three-week test, Demand Gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks, with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out Demand Gen for two new titles.
184 | 
185 | We’re also bringing new creative features to Demand Gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps, with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for upleveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently.
186 | 
187 | And then there’s obviously Search Generative Experience, which Sundar talked about. I’ll add that innovation in the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We’re continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including Search and Shopping ads alongside Search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We’re excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on -- and confident in the role SGE, including ads -- will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs.
188 | 
189 | Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, Retail was, again, a top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and offline, as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. Highlights include continued upsides for retailers leaning into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax or both.
190 | 
191 | Take home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google’s Store Sales measurement to understand its total omni-channel revenue opportunity across Search. By measuring 2.3 times more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omni-channel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni-revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally.
192 | 
193 | We also expanded Local Inventory Ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and offline sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pick-up options and more, all in one ad format.
194 | 
195 | Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar’s remarks.
196 | 
197 | First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences, and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before; and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%.
198 | 
199 | We also hit a new milestone with three million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists and media companies over the last three years.
200 | 
201 | From a viewer’s perspective, watchtime across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV.
202 | 
203 | According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watchtime for the last 12-plus months.
204 | 
205 | In the first quarter, Living Room benefited from a combination of strong watchtime growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube.
206 | 
207 | Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place, across screens and formats -- their favorite creators, live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can’t find elsewhere.
208 | 
209 | Which brings me to monetization. We’re pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ads-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth.
210 | 
211 | On the Ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, living room, and desktop and available to both performance and brand advertisers.
212 | 
213 | In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to instream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a ten-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone.
214 | 
215 | Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports; beauty, fashion and lifestyle; and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing Brand Lift is one of the core goals.
216 | 
217 | In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a Pause Ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that Pause ads are driving strong Brand Lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers.
218 | 
219 | Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we’re helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google.
220 | 
221 | Number one, to help McDonald’s build the “restaurant of the future,” we’re deepening our partnership across Cloud and Ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud’s latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences.
222 | 
223 | Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP’s AI-powered marketing operating system already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients including The Coca-Cola Company, L’Oreal and Nestle. We’re just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock.
224 | 
225 | With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we’re excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter.
226 | 
227 | Ruth, you’re up!
228 | 
229 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp.
230 | 
231 | We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, driven in particular by strength in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base.
232 | 
233 | My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise.
234 | 
235 | I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.
236 | 
237 | For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.
238 | 
239 | In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023, of $2.6 billion, as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024.
240 | 
241 | As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in Other Cost of Revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust Other Cost of Revenues, operating expenses, operating income and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024.
242 | 
243 | In terms of expenses, total Cost of Revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%.
244 | 
245 | Other Cost of Revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube, given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content.
246 | 
247 | On an adjusted basis, Other Cost of Revenues were up 13% year-on-year.
248 | 
249 | Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters.
250 | 
251 | On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting; first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in Sales and Marketing a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense, primarily for Cloud sales.
252 | 
253 | Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%.
254 | 
255 | On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%.
256 | 
257 | Net income was $23.7 billion, and EPS was $1.89.
258 | 
259 | We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities.
260 | 
261 | Turning to segment results, within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%.
262 | 
263 | Google Search & Other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail.
264 | 
265 | YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion, were up 21%, driven by both direct response and brand advertising.
266 | 
267 | Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%.
268 | 
269 | Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.
270 | 
271 | TAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%.
272 | 
273 | Google Services Operating Income was $27.9 billion, up 28%, and the operating margin was 40%.
274 | 
275 | Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP, with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.
276 | 
277 | Google Cloud delivered Operating Income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%.
278 | 
279 | As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion.
280 | 
281 | Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services. First, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response.
282 | 
283 | Looking ahead, two points to call out. First, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter.
284 | 
285 | Second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.
286 | 
287 | Turning to Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1, versus Q4, reflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus fourteen weeks in Q4.
288 | 
289 | Looking forward, we will anniversary last year’s price increase in YouTube TV starting in May.
290 | 
291 | With regard to Platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers.
292 | 
293 | With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions, as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively, while remaining focused on profitable growth.
294 | 
295 | As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet.
296 | 
297 | First, Q1 results reflect the benefit of Leap Year, which contributed slightly more than one point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter.
298 | 
299 | Second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1.
300 | 
301 | Turning to margins, our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods.
302 | 
303 | You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring.
304 | 
305 | As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and Technical Infrastructure.
306 | 
307 | Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.
308 | 
309 | With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers.
310 | 
311 | The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business.
312 | 
313 | Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx.
314 | 
315 | With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have workstreams under way to enhance overall returns.
316 | 
317 | Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $.20 per share to our capital return program, as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases.
318 | 
319 | The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today, given the extraordinary opportunities ahead. We view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program.
320 | 
321 | Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.
322 | 
323 | Operator: Thank you.
324 | 
325 | As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *1 on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated.
326 | 
327 | And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
328 | 
329 | Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have two.
330 | 
331 | The first one, I wanted to ask about overall Search behavior. Philipp, I know you talked in the past about how overall query trends continue to grow. Can I ask you to drill a little bit more into monetizable and commercial query trends? Have there been any changes in sort of your commercial query trend growth as there’s been all these new entrants moving around in e-commerce, is my first one.
332 | 
333 | The second one for Ruth. When you talked about sort of more efforts to moderate expense growth from here, can you just sort of give us some examples of areas where you still see the potential for more optimization or workstreams in place to continue to durably reengineer the OpEx space as we go throughout 2024? Thanks.
334 | 
335 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Brian.
336 | 
337 | To your first question, I think, broadly, we’ve always found that over many years, when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. So typically, the trends we see carry over well.
338 | 
339 | Overall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, we are definitely -- I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions, as well as in general it all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it’s still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience in front, but we are positive about what this transition means.
340 | 
341 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: And on the second question, in terms of the various workstreams, as both Sundar and I said, we remain very focused on the ongoing efforts to slow the pace of expense growth, what we have been calling durably reengineering our cost base.
342 | 
343 | I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx and so these efforts are ongoing.
344 | 
345 | They are very much the same that we have talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure, these are ongoing.
346 | 
347 | As an example, the work that Sundar talked about combining Devices and Services with our Platforms and Ecosystems product areas is a really good example, because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency.
348 | 
349 | And then the other workstreams we’ve talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure which Sundar alluded to; streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI; what we’re doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced; the work you’ve seen on real estate optimization -- these are all ongoing workstreams, which is why we have them under the umbrella of durably re-engineering our cost base and they are ongoing.
350 | 
351 | Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
352 | 
353 | Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions.
354 | 
355 | Sundar, you talked about bringing more Generative AI features into the main Search page. Can you just talk about what kind of queries or scenarios you think that that’s working best for so far and just how we should think about the cadence of continuing to adopt more of those features within Core Search?
356 | 
357 | And then, Ruth, on CapEx spending, the $12 billion in 1Q, can we assume that run-rating that and above is reasonable for this year? And I know it’s very early, but should we generally expect higher CapEx next year as well?
358 | 
359 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Doug.
360 | 
361 | On SGE and Search, look, I think it tends to really -- we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of factual answers, linked to sources across the web and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. And we have been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries, which are more complex where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience.
362 | 
363 | We’ve already served billions of queries, and it seems to cut across categories. But we are still continuing our testing and we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we’re seeing it in our metrics, and we’ll continue evolving it through the course of this year.
364 | 
365 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: And in terms of CapEx, as I said in opening comments, we do expect the quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the $12 billion cash CapEx we had here in Q1. As I said, you can always have variability in the reported quarterly CapEx just due to the timing of cash payments, but roughly at or above this level.
366 | 
367 | And it really goes to Sundar’s opening comment that we’re very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in Search that he and Philipp have spoken about, and our lead with Gemini.
368 | 
369 | I will note that most -- nearly all, I should say, of the CapEx was in our Technical Infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be about less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there.
370 | 
371 | And then with respect to 2025, as you said, it’s premature to comment, so nothing to add on that.
372 | 
373 | Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Great, thank you.
374 | 
375 | Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
376 | 
377 | Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thanks so much. Maybe just one question of the big-picture nature for Sundar.
378 | 
379 | To come back to your earlier comments at the beginning of the call in framing up longer-term initiatives and longer-term narratives, wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and the challenges of operating at scale in a time like this where there’s a lot of technology innovation going on. And how you see the elements of trying to strike a balance towards moving the organization forward while still continuing to both invest for growth as well as balance margin. Thanks so much.
380 | 
381 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Eric. Great question.
382 | 
383 | Obviously, the AI transition, I think it’s a once-in-a-generation kind of opportunity. We’ve definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine, we started building TPUs in 2016, so we have definitely been gearing up for a long time.
384 | 
385 | The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way and it impacts the entire breadth of the company -- be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo and so on. And we see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it’s a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead.
386 | 
387 | In terms of the challenges, I think making sure -- I think we are constantly -- I think it’s been a mindset shift, which we’ve been driving across the company, to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity, but being very efficient in how we are approaching it. Making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company; building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible.
388 | 
389 | So making sure balancing all of that moving forward in a very bold and responsible way at the same time, those are the important things to get right from my perspective.
390 | 
391 | Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open.
392 | 
393 | Stephen Ju (UBS): Thank you so much. Hi, Philipp.
394 | 
395 | I think it’s approaching the two-year anniversary for the launch of Ads on YouTube Shorts. I think you’ve given us an update on monetization pickup sequentially.
396 | 
397 | With that in mind, I think YouTube has launched an array of ad products and automation tools to help advertisers transfer what they’re doing to the vertical screen. So how is this translating into buy-in among your advertiser clients?
398 | 
399 | And, secondly, based on what you have seen over the last two years, are there any structural reasons that you can cite as to why the monetization cannot match what is already the case on the horizontal screen? Thanks.
400 | 
401 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yeah, look, this is a great question.
402 | 
403 | First of all, I mean, let’s start with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong this quarter. And on Shorts specifically, in the U.S., I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to instream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that’s what you were referring to. And, yes, we are, obviously, very happy with this development.
404 | 
405 | The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn’t be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That’s an important part, I think.
406 | 
407 | Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels, uploading has increased 50% year-over-year. So, again, very happy with this development.
408 | 
409 | And to your question, structural reasons, whether we can’t get to a match here, I have a hard time seeing those, at the moment, over time.
410 | 
411 | Stephen Ju (UBS): Thank you.
412 | 
413 | Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now.
414 | 
415 | Justin Post (BAML): Thank you. I’m going to ask another one about CapEx. It seems to be your biggest investment area.
416 | 
417 | Just first, you saw the big uptick the last two quarters, but you have been investing in AI for years. Is the uptick because supply is getting easier to get? Or do you see more opportunities with the available supply to really fuel AI, so as the GPUs and everything have gotten better, that you feel more -- investing more?
418 | 
419 | And then, thinking about the returns, both for advertising and Cloud on the CapEx, do you feel like this is a higher cost of doing business? Or do you think this is an opportunity to even get better returns on your capital spend than you’ve had in the past? Thank you.
420 | 
421 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So the increase in CapEx, as Sundar said and I said, really reflects the opportunity we continue to see across the company. It starts with all that we’re doing in support of the Gemini foundational model but then also, clearly, the work across Cloud, on behalf of Cloud customers and the growth that we’re seeing with GCP and the infrastructure work there. And then, of course, as both Sundar and Philipp talked about, the application across Search, YouTube and more broadly the services that we’re able to offer. So it’s the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet.
422 | 
423 | And it really goes to the second part of your question, which is that as we’re investing in CapEx and applying it across our various businesses, it opens up more service and products, which bring revenue opportunities, and we’re very focused on the monetization opportunity. It does underlie everything that we’re doing in Google Services and Google Cloud.
424 | 
425 | And as Sundar noted, we’re at the same time, very focused on the efficiency of all elements of delivering that compute capacity from hardware, software and beyond.
426 | 
427 | Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.
428 | 
429 | Jian Li (Evercore): Thank you. This is Jian Li for Mark Mahaney. A couple of questions.
430 | 
431 | One, just maybe an expansion on the Search query questions from before. More like Search volume and maybe in the context of the off-Google environments, like AI chatbots, for example, we’ve seen kind of Meta AI directing to Google Search results.
432 | 
433 | Do you think there’s actually a scenario where an AI system can create a step-function change in Search volume or use cases off Google? Can you give us more color on what you are seeing right now or what you are expecting to see in that area?
434 | 
435 | And then the second question on just the comment of YouTube and Cloud exiting at a $100 billion run rate. What is informing this outlook of visibility for you? If you can talk about is it driven by any sort of Cloud-demand inflection or step-change in the gen AI workload demand? If you can flush it out a little bit, thanks so much.
436 | 
437 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: In your first question, I said this before, but to be clear, we view this moment as a positive moment for Search. I think it allows us to evolve our product in a profound way. And Search is a unique experience. People come and they get to -- be it if you want answers, if you want to explore more, if you want to get perspectives from across the web, and to be able to do it across the breadth and depth of everything they’re looking for.
438 | 
439 | And the innovation you would need to keep that up, I think it’s what we’ve been building on for a long time. And so I feel we are extraordinarily well set up, particularly given the innovation path we are on. And overall, I view this moment as a positive moment.
440 | 
441 | So that’s how I would say it. On the second part, Ruth?
442 | 
443 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: I’m sorry, what was this -- I think --
444 | 
445 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: The YouTube and Cloud.
446 | 
447 | Jian Li (Evercore): In terms of your comment about a $100 billion exit rate for YouTube and Cloud, what’s driving this visibility for you? And any kind of inflection you are seeing in the Cloud demand.
448 | 
449 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: I would just say from Sundar’s opening comments, it’s just the ongoing momentum that we’ve seen in the business that we’ve been talking about the ongoing growth, the strong performance.
450 | 
451 | And so what we were really getting at in that comment, what Sundar was getting at is that we’ve continued to build strong businesses over time, and that just helps dimension it.
452 | 
453 | We had similar comments last quarter when you talk about our Subscriptions business. We’re really proud of all the work that teams are doing across the company, building new, strong opportunities, delivering for our users, for customers, for advertisers in profound ways. And so it was just helping to dimension what we had built over the years.
454 | 
455 | Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
456 | 
457 | Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo): Thank you very much. Two, if I may.
458 | 
459 | First on GCP, you had nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities and constraints upon GCP’s ability to continue to address that large addressable market and accelerate growth? Is it more sales-oriented? Is it more product sales solutions or both? Do you plan to address most of these organically, or could a partner approach work for you?
460 | 
461 | And then the second one, just more detail on YouTube and sports rights. Could you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There’s some larger, mostly in the U.S., league rights coming up soon, and will be more over the next several years. Could you just talk about your philosophy there beyond NFL Sunday Ticket? Thank you.
462 | 
463 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks. Look, on the Cloud side, obviously it’s definitely a point of inflection overall. I think the AI transformation is making everyone think about their whole stack, and we’re engaged in a number of conversations.
464 | 
465 | I think be it AI infrastructure, people are really looking to Vertex AI, given our depth and breadth of model choice, or using Workspace to transform productivity in your workplace, et cetera.
466 | 
467 | So I think the opportunities there are all related to that, both all the work we’ve built up and AI being a point of inflection in terms of driving conversations. I think you will see us do it both organically and with a strong partner program as well. So we will do it with a combination.
468 | 
469 | And the challenges here, always, there are switching costs to Cloud and the challenges we see is how do we make it easier for people. There’s a lot of interest, but there’s definitely barriers in terms of people switching. And so that’s an area where we are constantly investing to make it easier for our customers.
470 | 
471 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: With regard to your sports rights question, look, we’ve had longstanding and significant partnerships with the most popular sports leagues here in the U.S. and around the globe; federations teams, athletes, broadcasters. And obviously, these partnerships, in combination with our very vast audience of sports fans, drives investment in subscription experiences across many offerings; NFL Sunday Ticket, YouTube TV, YouTube Primetime Channels and so on.
472 | 
473 | But there’s nothing that we have to announce at the moment. We are obviously always looking at where we can create more value for our users, for advertisers, for creators; but nothing specific to talk about at this moment.
474 | 
475 | Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo): Thank you.
476 | 
477 | Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.
478 | 
479 | Ross Sandler (Barclays): Great. Sundar, I have a question about smartphone-based AI searches. So you guys are powering all these new AI interactions and searches on Pixel and on Samsung devices. And I think there’s speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in a future state.
480 | 
481 | So the question is, if users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model on the phone without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge? Any thoughts on that?
482 | 
483 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Look, I think, if you look at what users are looking for, people are looking for information and an ability to connect with things outside.
484 | 
485 | So I think there will be a set of use cases which you’ll be able to do on-device, but for a lot of what people are looking to do, I think you will need the richness of the cloud, the web, and you have to deliver it to users.
486 | 
487 | So again to my earlier comments, I think through all these moments, you saw what we have done with Samsung with Circle to Search. I think it gives a new way for people to access Search conveniently wherever they are. And so I view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. So I think it’s positive from that perspective.
488 | 
489 | In terms of on-device versus cloud, there will be needs which can be done on-device, and we should, to help it from a privacy standpoint. But there are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don’t see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus off-cloud in any way.
490 | 
491 | Operator: And our last question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is now open.
492 | 
493 | Colin Sebastian (Baird): Thanks. Good afternoon.
494 | 
495 | I guess first, follow-up on some of the questions on SGE and the Core Search. I guess I’m wondering along with some of those changes in behavior, is there a way to quantify that overall engagement shift? Whether that’s an increase in time spent or the level of increase in queries for both sort of traditional search as well as more generative answers.
496 | 
497 | And then secondly on the hardware roadmap, I assume later this year we’ll hear more about some of the products. But any areas of particular focus that you would point out that we should keep in mind in terms of hardware launches in the back half? Thank you.
498 | 
499 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On the first question on Search, not much more to add to what I said. But what we’ve seen, and remember we have been in live experiments just for a few weeks in the U.S. and U.K. and on a slice of our queries, all indications are positive that it improves user satisfaction. We see an increase in engagement, but I see this as something which will play out over time.
500 | 
501 | But if you were to step back, at this moment, there were a lot of questions last year, and we always felt confident and comfortable that we would be able to improve the user experience. People question whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries.
502 | 
503 | People worried about latency. I think when I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable.
504 | 
505 | There are questions about monetization. Based on our testing so far, I am comfortable and confident that we’ll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well.
506 | 
507 | It will play out over time, but I feel we are well-positioned. And more importantly, when I look at the innovation that’s ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead.
508 | 
509 | Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
510 | 
511 | Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2024 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.
512 | 
513 | Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

 20 | 
 21 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim. And hello, everyone.
 22 | 
 23 | I’m really pleased with our results this quarter. They show tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in Cloud, with our AI initiatives driving new growth.
 24 | 
 25 | Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI Overviews.
 26 | 
 27 | In Q2, Cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, and at the same time passed the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year to date, our AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues, and are being used by more than 2 million developers.
 28 | 
 29 | As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well-positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our research and infrastructure leadership means we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model-building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology continues to evolve.
 30 | 
 31 | Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long-term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next and Google Marketing Live, and we’ll touch on many of them here.
 32 | 
 33 | Today I’ll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally; followed by Cloud, YouTube and some closing thoughts. Let’s dive in.
 34 | 
 35 | Over the past 25 years, we’ve continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts.
 36 | 
 37 | With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of Search queries, and introducing new ways to Search.
 38 | 
 39 | We’re pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI Overviews, including increases in Search usage and increased user satisfaction with the results.
 40 | 
 41 | People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users, aged 18-24, when they use Search with AI Overviews.
 42 | 
 43 | As we’ve said, we’re continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. And we’re seeing that Ads appearing either above or below AI Overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses.
 44 | 
 45 | Beyond AI Overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address, and opens up powerful new ways to search.
 46 | 
 47 | Visual search via Lens is one. Soon, you’ll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already, we’ve seen that AI Overviews in Lens leads to an increase in overall visual search usage.
 48 | 
 49 | Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices.
 50 | 
 51 | We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools. And we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever.
 52 | 
 53 | Gemini now comes in four sizes, with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It’s a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle.
 54 | 
 55 | Gemini is making Google’s own products better. All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that is truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in Search, Workspace, Google Messages and more.
 56 | 
 57 | At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon you’ll be able to ask Photos questions like, “What did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year?”
 58 | 
 59 | For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We’ve always wanted to build a universal agent, and it’s an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life.
 60 | 
 61 | Our AI product advances come from our longstanding foundation of research leadership, as well as our global network of infrastructure.
 62 | 
 63 | In Q2, we announced our first data center and Cloud region in Malaysia, and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia and Ohio.
 64 | 
 65 | Our TPUs are a key bet here, too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it is our best-performing and most energy-efficient TPU to date.
 66 | 
 67 | It achieves a near 5X increase in peak compute performance per chip and is 67% more energy-efficient compared to TPU v5e.
 68 | 
 69 | And the latest NVIDIA Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025.
 70 | 
 71 | We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see ahead.
 72 | 
 73 | Of course, as we do this, we will continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models.
 74 | 
 75 | For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI Overviews, while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI Overview served flat.
 76 | 
 77 | And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query, in order to minimize impact on costs and latency.
 78 | 
 79 | Separately, on our real estate investments, we’re taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce, as well as our local communities.
 80 | 
 81 | Next, Google Cloud.
 82 | 
 83 | We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to their large customer base.
 84 | 
 85 | Our momentum begins with our AI Infrastructure, which provides AI start-ups like Essential AI with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications.
 86 | 
 87 | We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 Mega, powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3.
 88 | 
 89 | Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher and the U.S. Air Force build powerful AI agents.
 90 | 
 91 | Last month, we announced a number of new advances: Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing.
 92 | 
 93 | We broadened support for third-party models, including Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and open source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral.
 94 | 
 95 | We are the only cloud provider to offer Grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody’s, MSCI, ZoomInfo and more. Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps Click Therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments.
 96 | 
 97 | Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better quality software, find insights from their data, and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini.
 98 | 
 99 | Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini Code Assist to develop, test, and document software faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster.
100 | 
101 | Cybersecurity risks continue to accelerate and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our Mandiant teams help manage.
102 | 
103 | Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability make Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture.
104 | 
105 | Turning next to YouTube. YouTube is focused on a clear strategy: connecting creators with a massive audience, and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions, while helping advertisers reach their desired audience.
106 | 
107 | We had a great Brandcast this quarter, and Philipp will say more. I’m pleased at the progress here. YouTube has remained number one in U.S. streaming watchtime, according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube Shorts on connected TVs more than doubled last year, and we’re making it easier for creators to add captions, and turn regular videos into Shorts.
108 | 
109 | Next on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung’s new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event.
110 | 
111 | I’m looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We’ll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices.
112 | 
113 | Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced the new Pixel 8a, powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences, like Circle to Search, Best Take and a Gemini-powered AI assistant.
114 | 
115 | In Other Bets, I’m really pleased with the progress Waymo is making, a real leader in the space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo has served more than 2 million trips to date, and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo is now delivering well over 50,000 weekly paid, public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix.
116 | 
117 | And in June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver’s seat.
118 | 
119 | Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth’s final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I’m excited to continue to work with her in her new role.
120 | 
121 | And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you’ll hear from her on our call next quarter.
122 | 
123 | Thanks as always to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2.
124 | 
125 | With that, over to you, Philipp.
126 | 
127 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar. And hello, everyone.
128 | 
129 | Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year.
130 | 
131 | Search & Other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the Retail vertical, followed by Financial Services.
132 | 
133 | YouTube Ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, as well as direct response.
134 | 
135 | Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year.
136 | 
137 | In Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions.
138 | 
139 | For the rest of my remarks, I want to double-click on two topics. First, how we are applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger Ads experience. Second, YouTube’s position as the leading multi-format platform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we are applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses.
140 | 
141 | Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live, and Cannes, a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses.
142 | 
143 | This quarter we announced over 30 new Ads features and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, Demand Gen and Retail, we are applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production and provide more engaging experiences for consumers.
144 | 
145 | Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets.
146 | 
147 | For example, as part of a new and easier-to-use Merchant Center, we’ve expanded Product Studio with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image, prompt the AI with something like “feature this product with the Paris skyline in the background,” and Product Studio will generate campaign-ready assets.
148 | 
149 | I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We are beta testing virtual try-on in shopping ads, and plan to roll it out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and a higher click-out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns.
150 | 
151 | Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to Performance Max and Standard Shopping campaigns. Advertisers who use profit optimization in Smart Bidding see a 15% uplift in profit, on average, compared to revenue-only bidding.
152 | 
153 | Lastly, Demand Gen is rolling out to Display & Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months, with new generative image tools that create stunning, high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, Demand Gen delivers an average of 14% more conversions.
154 | 
155 | The use cases we are seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share two examples with you.
156 | 
157 | Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged Demand Gen during the holiday season and saw a 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions, such as adding items to carts and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6 times more efficient cost-per-click compared to social media benchmarks.
158 | 
159 | Our own Google Marketing team used Demand Gen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for a Pixel 8 Campaign shown across YouTube, Discover and Gmail, delivering twice the click-through rate at nearly a quarter of the cost.
160 | 
161 | In addition to strengthening our Ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models, delivering further performance gains.
162 | 
163 | In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance and language understanding have improved Broad Match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding.
164 | 
165 | Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to Broad Match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns, see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost.
166 | 
167 | We’ll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for Ads.
168 | 
169 | Now let’s turn to YouTube. I’ve talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize.
170 | 
171 | First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audiences tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two weeks ago, MrBeast’s channel hit more than 300 million subscribers.
172 | 
173 | Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years.
174 | 
175 | According to Nielsen, YouTube is the number one most-watched streaming platform on TV screens in the U.S. for the 17th consecutive month.
176 | 
177 | Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most-watched after Disney.
178 | 
179 | And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including Sports, which has seen CTV watchtime on YouTube grow 30% year over year.
180 | 
181 | Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watchtime growth, viewer and advertiser innovation, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube.
182 | 
183 | Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco, and home and personal care are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations.
184 | 
185 | Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show the many ways their plans and offerings can be customized to fit people’s lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon’s creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads.
186 | 
187 | Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the U.S., the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to instream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth.
188 | 
189 | Again, this quarter, we continued to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the U.S. We’re also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year.
190 | 
191 | Lastly, a few words on Shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watchtime for videos that help people shop. While it’s still early days, Shopping remains a key area of investment.
192 | 
193 | At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube Shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included; product tagging, where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections, and a new Affiliate Hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings.
194 | 
195 | With that, I’ll finish by saying a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment, and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust.
196 | 
197 | And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years. Now, for one last time, it’s over to you.
198 | 
199 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp. And thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise.
200 | 
201 | I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.
202 | 
203 | For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14%, or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.
204 | 
205 | In terms of expenses, total Cost of Revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other Cost of Revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian digital services tax which was applied retroactively.
206 | 
207 | Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D, partially offset by a decline in G&A, with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year.
208 | 
209 | The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation, which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain Other Bets in the second quarter last year, followed by depreciation.
210 | 
211 | The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters.
212 | 
213 | Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26%, and our operating margin was 32%.
214 | 
215 | Net income was $23.6 billion, and EPS was $1.89.
216 | 
217 | We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months.
218 | 
219 | As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter, and will do so again next quarter.
220 | 
221 | We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities.
222 | 
223 | Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%.
224 | 
225 | Google Search & Other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in Retail, followed by the Financial Services vertical.
226 | 
227 | YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13%, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising.
228 | 
229 | Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%.
230 | 
231 | Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues were $9.3 billion, up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.
232 | 
233 | TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%.
234 | 
235 | Google Services Operating Income was $29.7 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 40%.
236 | 
237 | Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting: first, significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for Cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI; and second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.
238 | 
239 | Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%.
240 | 
241 | As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million and the operating loss was $1.1 billion.
242 | 
243 | Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services. First, within Advertising, the strong performance of Search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watchtime growth, continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts, and had continued momentum in Connected TV with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital.
244 | 
245 | As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers.
246 | 
247 | Turning to Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate as we anniversaried the impact of the price increase for YouTube TV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year.
248 | 
249 | Second, with regard to Platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play, driven by an increase in buyers.
250 | 
251 | Finally, with respect to Devices, the most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year, benefiting revenues in Q3 this year.
252 | 
253 | Turning to Cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profits. As Sundar noted, year to date, our AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers.
254 | 
255 | We’re particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our Generative AI Solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business.
256 | 
257 | Turning to margins, the margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure.
258 | 
259 | Once again, headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring.
260 | 
261 | Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud and Technical Infrastructure.
262 | 
263 | Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.
264 | 
265 | However, in the third quarter, operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, as well as the increase in Cost of Revenues due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3.
266 | 
267 | With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers.
268 | 
269 | Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx.
270 | 
271 | With regard to Other Bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies as we invest for long term returns. Waymo is an important example of this, with its technical leadership, coupled with progress on operational performance.
272 | 
273 | As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multiyear investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels, will enable Waymo to continue to build the world’s leading autonomous driving technology company.
274 | 
275 | To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet, so I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude.
276 | 
277 | I have been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think we have accomplished a lot in the last nine-plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue.
278 | 
279 | Of course, I’m not going far, and I’m honored to have my new role, which I’ve been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months, and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar and our great team.
280 | 
281 | Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google’s mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO.
282 | 
283 | Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today, and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet’s focus.
284 | 
285 | I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long term support and your feedback.
286 | 
287 | Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.
288 | 
289 | Operator: Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press *1 on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated.
290 | 
291 | Your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
292 | 
293 | Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Thanks for taking my questions. First, thank you Ruth for all of the help and significant impact over the past decade.
294 | 
295 | The first one, it’s a little bit of a jump ball, I guess, for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we’re sort of 18 months into this fever pitch around a GenAI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspectives, can you sort of talk to us about areas where you’ve seen faster-than-expected traction, testing, or adoption of some of the Generative AI capabilities versus slower-than-expected traction and testing, from a Google perspective?
296 | 
297 | And then Ruth, appreciate all the comments about structurally re-engineering the OpEx base. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company? Thanks.
298 | 
299 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Brian, thanks. I’ll take the first part. I think it’s a good question.
300 | 
301 | Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side.
302 | 
303 | Definitely on the consumer side, I’m pleased, as I said in my comments earlier, in terms of how, for a product like Search, which is used at scale over many decades, how we’ve been able to introduce it in a way that it’s additive and enhances the overall experience and is positively contributing there.
304 | 
305 | I think across our consumer products, we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously, monetization is something we will have to earn on top of it.
306 | 
307 | On the enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where there are definitely a lot of models. I think roughly the models are all kind of converging towards a sort of base capabilities but I think where the next wave is working is to build solutions on top of it.
308 | 
309 | And I think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, et cetera, where we are seeing some of those use cases seeing traction. But I still think there’s hard work there to completely unlock those.
310 | 
311 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: And on your second question, first, thank you for your comments.
312 | 
313 | Look, the reason we consistently use the term, the phrase, that we’re focused on durably re-engineering our cost base is because these are deep workstreams. They’re not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we’ve talked about are around product and process prioritization, around organizational efficiency and structure.
314 | 
315 | Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. Across all of those, as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them.
316 | 
317 | So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter, with the combination of the Devices and Services product area, with the Platforms and Ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April.
318 | 
319 | And what we discussed last quarter and what we’re seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations helps with product execution, and what we’re really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving.
320 | 
321 | And then more broadly, all of the workstreams that we’ve talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the workstreams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there.
322 | 
323 | We’re also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We’re continuing to build on what we’ve done with our centralized procurement organization. We’re continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. And so, again, this is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase “durably re-engineering our cost base.”
324 | 
325 | Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thank you both.
326 | 
327 | Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
328 | 
329 | Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar.
330 | 
331 | Ruth, you’ve now had Google Services operating margins roughly 40% for the past two quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going forward?
332 | 
333 | And then, Sundar, just as it relates to AI Overviews, you talked about the positive trends there. Can you just help us understand where you are, how far along in rolling out AI Overviews? Then any more color around sort of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches? Thanks.
334 | 
335 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So in terms of the Google Services operating margin, it did reflect all the work that we’re doing on durably re-engineering the cost base. It also reflected the benefit of strong revenue performance in Search.
336 | 
337 | And so what I tried to lay out in the comments, as we look forward to the third quarter, is operating margins will reflect the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of our investment in technical infrastructure.
338 | 
339 | It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch due to the pull forward. So those are important factors.
340 | 
341 | I would say overall, company-wide, it’s important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023, but did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3.
342 | 
343 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On the AI Overviews, we’ve rolled it out in the U.S. and we will be, through the course of the year, definitely scaling it up both to more countries and also we’ve taken a conservative start, focused on quality, making sure the metrics are healthy and so on.
344 | 
345 | But you will see us expand the use cases around it, and we’ll touch definitely more queries. All the feedback we have seen is positive.
346 | 
347 | On the monetization side, I think Philipp has touched upon it. Maybe, Philipp, anything more you want to add there?
348 | 
349 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yeah, look, innovation and improvements to the user experience on Search have historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We talked about this before. We saw this when we navigated from desktop to mobile, for example. And we can see GenAI, obviously, expand the types of questions we can help people with, as Sundar mentioned. And as we said before, people are finding ads either above or below AI Overviews helpful. We have a solid baseline here from which we can innovate.
350 | 
351 | And as you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we’ll actually start testing Search and Shopping ads in AI Overviews for users in the U.S. And they will have the opportunity to actually appear within the AI Overview in a section clearly labeled as “sponsored” when they’re relevant to both the query and the information in the AI Overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level.
352 | 
353 | Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thank you. Best of luck, Ruth, in your new role.
354 | 
355 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you.
356 | 
357 | Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
358 | 
359 | Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Philipp.
360 | 
361 | Sundar, on the decision this week to not deprecate cookies, I know it’s been a long journey, can you talk a bit about what we should expect in terms of your experience in Chrome? And why the company made the decision not to go down the path of deprecating cookies?
362 | 
363 | Philipp, I know it was only one quarter, but it’s interesting that Search is growing faster than YouTube, which surprised some of us. Can you talk about what factors you think are behind the difference between growth rates between these markets? Is there anything on the AI front you can see maybe reaccelerating YouTube growth, as you have seen happen in Search? Thanks so much.
364 | 
365 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Michael, on cookies, obviously, we are super committed to improving privacy for users in Chrome, and that was the whole focus around Privacy Sandbox, and we remain committed on the journey.
366 | 
367 | But on third-party cookies, given the implications across the ecosystems and considerations and feedback across so many stakeholders, we now believe user choice is the best path forward there. And we’ll both improve privacy, by giving users choice, and we will continue our investments in privacy-enhancing technologies. But it’s obviously an area we will be taking feedback from the players in the ecosystem. And we are committed to being privacy-first as well.
368 | 
369 | Philipp?
370 | 
371 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: On the second part of your question, maybe, Ruth, you want to jump in first and then I take the rest if needed?
372 | 
373 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Absolutely.
374 | 
375 | Look, as we both noted, Search revenues really reflected broad-based growth across verticals. That was led by Retail, followed by Financial Services.
376 | 
377 | I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison. And as both Philipp and I noted, we are really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team, all that was done, it was driven by brand, followed by direct response. And they have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on.
378 | 
379 | I think the important point to note, and I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter. Because at that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year. And then also Q1 benefited from the extra day from leap year. And so what you’re also seeing here is, with YouTube, we were anniversarying the ramp in APAC-based retailers that began in the second quarter last year and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted.
380 | 
381 | And so there’s some timing issues going on, and what we’re trying to highlight is the underlying operating strength.
382 | 
383 | Back to you, Philipp.
384 | 
385 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yeah, that was very comprehensive. Nothing really to add from my side here.
386 | 
387 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: The only thing I would say to Brian’s first question on areas where things are maybe taking longer, I think look, we are all building multimodal models. At least Gemini has been natively multimodal from the ground up. But most of the use cases today that have been unlocked have been around the text side.
388 | 
389 | So in terms of getting real generative audio, video experiences working well, I think it’s going to take some time. But over time, obviously, it will be deeply relevant to YouTube.and so it’s an area I’m excited about in the future.
390 | 
391 | Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson): Thanks, all. Best to you, Ruth.
392 | 
393 | Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
394 | 
395 | Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thanks so much. And I’ll echo the thanks for Ruth for all the insights and partnership over the years on these earnings calls.
396 | 
397 | Sundar, maybe first for you. In terms of Cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, wanted to know if you would go a little bit deeper in terms of how you’re seeing AI actually get adopted and implemented? What it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the Cloud business and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for Cloud first?
398 | 
399 | And then following up, the last set of the questions on YouTube were really about the macro or the ad environment. What do you guys as a team continue to learn about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer? Thanks.
400 | 
401 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Eric.
402 | 
403 | Look, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it’s something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks already, if you take a look at our AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions for Cloud, across everything we do, be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace, and Gemini for Google Cloud, et cetera, we definitely are seeing traction.
404 | 
405 | People are deeply engaging with the Gemini models across Vertex and AI Studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things.
406 | 
407 | You are definitely seeing early use cases. But I think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress and unlocking value, which I’m very bullish will happen. But these things take time.
408 | 
409 | But if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here. And I think particularly for us, given the extent to which we are investing in AI, our research and infrastructure leadership, all of that translates directly. And so I’m pretty excited about the opportunity space ahead.
410 | 
411 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: And then on your second question, with respect to the subscriptions, implicit in your question, how strong is it, as I noted in opening comments, that overall line, Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices delivered healthy growth, and that was led by Subscriptions.
412 | 
413 | And as we’ve said on many calls here in a row, the Subscription revenue growth continued to be quite strong. It was driven by subscriber growth in both YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium.
414 | 
415 | And then the other component within that line is Google One, that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth. I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube, and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. So it continues to be very strong. We see a lot of takeup in it, strong subscriber growth. Really pleased with it.
416 | 
417 | We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversarying this YouTube TV price increase. But at the heart of it are people interested in the subscription offerings, and it’s a takeup that’s significant. We are really pleased with it.
418 | 
419 | Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you.
420 | 
421 | Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.
422 | 
423 | Ross Sandler (Barclays): Hi, everybody. Just two questions on the AI CapEx.
424 | 
425 | So it looks like, from the outside at least, that the hyperscaler industry going from kind of an underbuilt situation this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you think that’s a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle?
426 | 
427 | And then related to that, do you think that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation-model improvement in AI training based on lack of availability of new data to train on? Just your thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.
428 | 
429 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, Ross. Great questions.
430 | 
431 | Look, obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area. And in technology, when you are going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area, which in a leveraged way, cuts across all our core areas, our products, including Search, YouTube and Other Services as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term bets and Other Bets. It is definitely something that for us makes sense to lean in.
432 | 
433 | The one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here. Even in scenarios where if it turns out we are overinvesting, these are infrastructure which are widely useful for us, they have long useful lives, and we can apply it across and we can work through that.
434 | 
435 | But I think not investing to be at the front here, I think, definitely has much more significant downsides.
436 | 
437 | Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams work super hard, I’m proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that’s how we think about it.
438 | 
439 | To your second question on how did the scaling laws hold, are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard and there’s going to be a few efforts which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models.
440 | 
441 | What I would tell is, regardless of how that plays out, I still think there is enough optimizations we’re all doing which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models.
442 | 
443 | And more importantly, taking them and translating them into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side. I think on that frontier, I think there’s still a lot of progress to be had. And so we are pretty focused on that as well.
444 | 
445 | Ross Sandler (Barclays): Thank you.
446 | 
447 | Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open.
448 | 
449 | Stephen Ju (UBS): Okay. Thank you so much.
450 | 
451 | Sundar, I guess to ask the AI question a different way, as we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side. But when do you think we’ll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can, hopefully, create greater value over time, versus just cutting costs?
452 | 
453 | And, Philipp, listening to what will be, I guess, Ruth’s final comments on YouTube on these public calls -- and thank you, by the way, Ruth, for all the help.
454 | 
455 | I couldn’t help but notice that the bigger factors were brand followed by direct response. And if we continue to think that the one you bring up first is the larger factor, and tying this into your prior commentary about Shopping being an important consideration, when do you think we’ll start talking about direct response being a much bigger contributor to YouTube’s growth versus brand? Thank you.
456 | 
457 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: To the first part of the question, look, I think the technology is horizontal enough, it can apply on both sides. If you take a use case like improving the customer service experience, there’s a part of it which is driving efficiencies, and you can look at it from a cost standpoint. But you could also be overall improving the experience, improving conversion, driving the funnel better. And so increasing basket size, if you are a retail eCommerce player, et cetera. So we are seeing people experiment across both sides. And so I think you will see it layered across both sides.
458 | 
459 | Philipp, on the second one?
460 | 
461 | Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Yes, on the second one, look on the direct response side, as you know, it’s about driving and converting commercial intent. Customers are obviously benefiting from including video in their AI-powered campaigns. Could be PMax. Could be Demand Gen. And obviously using our automated tools to enhance and create video creatives and we are very, very optimistic about this path.
462 | 
463 | On average, advertisers who run both image and video ads with Demand Gen campaign see 6% more conversions per dollar than those running image-only ads on Discovery. And this is just one little example of how this can, obviously, boost your performance business, so that’s a big part.
464 | 
465 | The brand side, as you know, Google AI continues to make it easier for brands to show up next to the content where viewers are obviously the most engaged. And they’re finding it, as you can see from the numbers, a very effective way to drive awareness and consideration.
466 | 
467 | We’re also quite excited about some of the recent launches on the YouTube Shopping side, if you want to put that into the direct response bucket.
468 | 
469 | Stephen Ju (UBS): Thank you.
470 | 
471 | Operator: And our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
472 | 
473 | Justin Post (Bank of America): Great. I’d like to ask about a couple of areas. First on the Cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year-to-date or is that more of a rebound in just general compute and other demand? Or is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration?
474 | 
475 | And then I wanted to ask about your internal cost savings, which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? And just would love to hear about how you are applying AI to cut your own costs. Thank you.
476 | 
477 | Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Great. Thank you for that.
478 | 
479 | So overall, as both Sundar and I said, we are very pleased with the results in Cloud. And there is clearly a benefit as the Cloud team is engaging broadly with customers around the globe with AI-related solutions, AI Infrastructure solutions and the Generative AI Solutions.
480 | 
481 | I think we noted that we’re particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our Generative AI Solutions. So it is clearly adding to the strength of the business on top of all that they’re doing. And just to be really clear, the results for GCP, the growth rate for GCP, is above the growth for Cloud overall.
482 | 
483 | And then I will turn to Sundar on the cost-saving point.
484 | 
485 | But just one point, we are really pleased as well that Cloud’s margin improved as it did, and in part that reflects the revenue strength that they delivered and all of the efficiency efforts that I’ve already spoken about.
486 | 
487 | But looking ahead in Q3, we do expect the same seasonal pattern that you saw last year with respect to margin, and we are continuing to invest in the business.
488 | 
489 | Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Look, I think specifically, if the question is about engineers and coding, et cetera, we definitely want to be on the cutting edge there. I think we are making these tools available to some of the most productive engineers and demanding engineers out there and they are definitely kicking the tires hard.
490 | 
491 | But I would say it’s still all in very early stages, particularly when it comes to writing high-quality secure code.
492 | 
493 | But I think all the learnings, what we are gaining here, will translate into our models and products. And that’s the virtuous cycle which I’m excited by. So there’s a lot more to come.
494 | 
495 | Justin Post (Bank of America): Great. Thank you.
496 | 
497 | Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
498 | 
499 | Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2024 call. Thank you and have a good evening.
500 | 
501 | Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
  2 | 
  3 | Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's second-quarter 2024 Q&A webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, head of investor relations and I'm joined today by Elon Musk; Vaibhav Taneja; and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.
  4 | 
  5 | During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
  6 | 
  7 | Elon?
  8 | 
  9 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
 10 | 
 11 | Thank you. So to recap, we saw large adoption and acceleration of EVs and then a bit of a hangover as others struggled to make compelling EVs. So there have been quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market and mostly, they have not done well, but they have discounted their EVs quite substantially, which has made it more a bit difficult for Tesla. We don't see this as a long-term issue, but really as fairly short term.
 12 | 
 13 | And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircraft and boats. Despite many challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business. And we're investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products.
 14 | 
 15 | We won't get too much into the product road map here because that is reserved for product announcement events. But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year. The big -- really, by far, the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. In addition to that, we have scale economies and, I think, we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world.
 16 | 
 17 | So this -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotics stack, we're pursuing all of them. This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus. Regarding full self-driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with full self-driving in Q2. And with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works.
 18 | 
 19 | Version 12.5 has five times the parameters of 12.4 and finally merged the highway and city stacks. So the highway stack at this point is pretty old. So often the issues people encounter are on the highway. But with 12.5, we finally merged the two stacks.
 20 | 
 21 | I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is. And I would encourage anyone to understand the system better to simply try it out and let the car drive you around. One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure that people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it. And just driving around the block.
 22 | 
 23 | Once people use it, they tend to continue using it. So it's very compelling. And this, I think, will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver. And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in the fleet.
 24 | 
 25 | We postponed the Robotaxi product unveil by a couple of months where it's shifted to 10/10, to the 10th of October. And this is because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle -- the sort of -- the Robotaxi -- the thing -- the main thing that we're going to show. And we're also going to show up a couple of other things. So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as adding a couple of other things for the product unveil.
 26 | 
 27 | We're also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date. So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our hardware for AI5 at Tesla AI computer. With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory. And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 and limited production starting early next year.
 28 | 
 29 | This will be for Tesla consumption. It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves. But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories. And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit.
 30 | 
 31 | And at that point, we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers. That will be a production Version 2 of Optimus. For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else. This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.
 32 | 
 33 | So we're ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building our -- building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially. So in conclusion, we're super excited about the progress across the board. We're changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy.
 34 | 
 35 | The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright. I really just can't emphasize the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus. Although the numbers sound crazy, I think, Tesla is producing at volume with and supervised MSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate a giant autonomous fleet. And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number.
 36 | 
 37 | ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong. And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number. I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
 38 | 
 39 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
 40 | 
 41 | Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
 42 | 
 43 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
 44 | 
 45 | As Elon mentioned, the Tesla team rose to the occasion yet again and delivered on all fronts with some notable records. In addition to those records, we saw our automotive deliveries grow sequentially. I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts in delivering a great quarter. On the auto business front, affordability remains top of mind for customers and in response, in Q2, we offered attractive financing options to offset sustained high interest rates.
 46 | 
 47 | These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter. These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs. We're now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world. This is the best time to buy a Tesla.
 48 | 
 49 | I mean, if you're waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car. We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenue as well. On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially. It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEM's plans for kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations.
 50 | 
 51 | We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories. As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price. We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network is the right strategy to combat range anxiety.
 52 | 
 53 | Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further. Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck. While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered. Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods.
 54 | 
 55 | While our teams are working feverishly to offset these. Unfortunately, it may have an impact on the cost in the near term. We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was made over time is bearing the expected results. Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business.
 56 | 
 57 | Energy storage backlog is strong. As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline. Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing, as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities. Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business.
 58 | 
 59 | The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring and other on the income statement. Just to level set, this was about $642 million of charge, which got recorded in the period. And I want people to remember that we called it out separately on the financials. Sequentially, our operating expenses, excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related activities and higher legal and other costs.
 60 | 
 61 | On the capex front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in capex as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster on line. This new center will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives. We reverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2. This was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter and we ended the quarter with over $30 billion of cash and investments.
 62 | 
 63 | Once again, we've begun the journey toward the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed. It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.
 64 | 
 65 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
 66 | 
 67 | Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now let's go to investor questions. The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?
 68 | 
 69 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
 70 | 
 71 | With respect to Roadster, we've completed most of the engineering. And I think there's still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next year. It will be something special. Like the whole thing might be.
 72 | 
 73 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
 74 | 
 75 | Fantastic. The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we've already covered. So we'll go to the next question. When do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
 76 | 
 77 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
 78 | 
 79 | I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving. It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year.
 80 | 
 81 | So next year seems highly probable to me based on quite simply plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention. That trend exceeds the humans for sure next year, so yes.
 82 | 
 83 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
 84 | 
 85 | Thank you very much. Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it. Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
 86 | 
 87 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
 88 | 
 89 | I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- a specific product announcement event rather than earnings calls.
 90 | 
 91 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
 92 | 
 93 | Great. Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production? And how is the ramp-up progressing?
 94 | 
 95 | Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering
 96 | 
 97 | 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more sales than Q1, while reducing COGS significantly. We currently produce more than 1,400 cybertrucks of 4680 cells a week. We'll continue to ramp upward as we drive cost down further toward the cost parity target we set for the end of the year. We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone, and we're super proud of that.
 98 | 
 99 | We're on track for production launch with the dry cathode in Q4. And this will enable cell costs to be significantly below available alternatives which was the original goal of the 4680 program.
100 | 
101 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
102 | 
103 | Great. The next question is any update on Dojo?
104 | 
105 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
106 | 
107 | Yes. So Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this -- I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get steady out NVIDIA GPUs and when we want them.
108 | 
109 | And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have -- in order to ensure that we've got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo. And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and it's obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high. So I think we've really got to make Dojo work and we will.
110 | 
111 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
112 | 
113 | Great. The next question is, what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?
114 | 
115 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
116 | 
117 | There's -- Optimus is intended to be a generalized humanoid robot with a lot of intelligence. So it's like saying what kind of accessories will be offered by the human. It's just the intent to be able to be backward compatible with human tasks. So it would use any accessories that a human would use.
118 | 
119 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
120 | 
121 | The next question is, do you feel you're cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?
122 | 
123 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
124 | 
125 | We are not doing some advertising, so want to say something?
126 | 
127 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
128 | 
129 | Yes, I'll say something. Fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best for -- at a reasonable price to the consumers. Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who had never owned a Tesla before which is encouraging.
130 | 
131 | We've spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy. We're not saying no to advertising. But this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore, plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
132 | 
133 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
134 | 
135 | Great. The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in the opening remarks. So we'll move on to the next one. What is the updated time line for Giga Mexico? And what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
136 | 
137 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
138 | 
139 | Well, we currently are poised on Giga Mexico. I think we need to see just where things stand after the election. Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico. So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case.
140 | 
141 | So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically. However, we're increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly. And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be locally produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
142 | 
143 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
144 | 
145 | All right. Thank you, sir, as well.
146 | 
147 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
148 | 
149 | And as well Optimus toward the end of next year for Optimus production version 2 -- the high-volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
150 | 
151 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
152 | 
153 | Great. Just a couple more. Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
154 | 
155 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
156 | 
157 | There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving. And I suspect there will be more over time. But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
158 | 
159 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
160 | 
161 | Right. And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
162 | 
163 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
164 | 
165 | I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI. It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center. With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment. But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that.
166 | 
167 | And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.
168 | 
169 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
170 | 
171 | All right. Thanks very much. And now we will move on to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
172 | 
173 | Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
174 | 
175 | William Stein -- Analyst
176 | 
177 | Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. And this relates a little bit to the last 1 that was asked. Elon, I share your strong enthusiasm about AI and I recognize Tesla's opportunity to do some great things with the technology.
178 | 
179 | But there are some concerns I have about Tesla's commercialization and that's what I'd like to ask about. Specifically, there were some new stories through the quarter that indicated that you redirected some AI compute systems that were destined for Tesla instead to xAI or perhaps it was to X, I'm not sure. And similarly, a few quarters ago, if you recall, I asked about your ability to hire engineers in this area. And you noted that there was a great desire for some of these engineers to work on projects that you were involved with, but some of them weren't at Tesla.
180 | 
181 | They were instead at xAI or perhaps even X, again. So the question is when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures? And how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them?
182 | 
183 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
184 | 
185 | Yeah. I mean I think you're referring to a very -- like an old article regarding GPUs. I think that's like six or seven months old. Tesla simply had no place to try them on.
186 | 
187 | So it would have been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to order H100s and have no place to try them on. So I was just -- this wasn't a let's pick xAI over Tesla. There was no -- the Tesla data centers were full. There was no place to actually put them.
188 | 
189 | The -- we've been working 24/7 to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas. That South extension is what will house 50,000 H100s and we're beginning to move the H100 server racks into place there. But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically. You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible.
190 | 
191 | So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest. Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on. That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week. We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.
192 | 
193 | With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI. So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up. So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not involved. Those are the two choices.
194 | 
195 | This wasn't they would come to Tesla. They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances. So yes.
196 | 
197 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
198 | 
199 | Yeah. I mean I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum. And there are a lot of things which we are focused on full self-driving at Tesla and also Optimus. But there is the other spectrum of AI, which we're not working on and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI.
200 | 
201 | So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum. It's not just one specific thing.
202 | 
203 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
204 | 
205 | Yeah. And once again, I want to just repeat myself here. I tried to recruit them to Tesla, including to say, like, you can work on AGI if you want and they refused. Only then was xAI created.
206 | 
207 | William Stein -- Analyst
208 | 
209 | I really appreciate that clarification. If I can ask one follow-up. It relates to the new vehicles that you're planning to introduce next year? I understand this is not the venue for product announcements. But when we think about the focus, I've heard on the one hand that the focus is on cost reduction.
210 | 
211 | On the other hand, you also said that the Roadster would come out. Should we expect other maybe more limited variants like similar to the cars that you make today, but with some changes or improvements or different -- some other variability in the form factors. Should we expect that to be a significant part of the strategy in the next year or two?
212 | 
213 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
214 | 
215 | I don't want to get into the details of product announcements. And we have to be careful of the Osborne effect here. So if you start announcing some great things, it could affect your near-term sales. We're going to make great products in the future just like we have in the past, end of story.
216 | 
217 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
218 | 
219 | That's right. The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
220 | 
221 | Ben Kallo -- Analyst
222 | 
223 | Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term? And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue? And then my follow-up is just on the last call, you talked about distributing compute on your new hardware. Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the time line for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power in their cars?
224 | 
225 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
226 | 
227 | Yeah. I mean, as I have said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined. So it's simply just never considered the usefulness, utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you asked of it. I think everyone on earth is going to want one.
228 | 
229 | There are 8 billion people on earth. So it's 8 billion right there. Then you've got all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not, way more. So I suspect that the long-term demand for general purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units.
230 | 
231 | And Tesla has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not. And we've got a lot of experience with -- the most experienced -- we're the word leaders in Real World AI. So we have all of the ingredients. I think we're unique in having all of the ingredients necessary for large scale, high utility, generalized humanoid robots.
232 | 
233 | That's why, my rough estimate long term is in accordance with the ARK Invest analysis of market cap on the order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport, and it's several times that number for general-purpose humanoid robots. I mean, at that point, I'm not sure what money it even means, but in the benign AI scenario, we are headed for an age of abundance, where there is no shortage of goods and services. Anyone can have pretty much anything they want. It's a wild -- pretty wild future we are heading for.
234 | 
235 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
236 | 
237 | And on the distributed compute?
238 | 
239 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
240 | 
241 | Yeah. Just distributed compute. It seems like a pretty obvious thing to do. I think where the distributed compute becomes interesting is with next-generation Tesla AI truck, which is hardware viable, what we're calling AI5, which is from the standpoint of inference capability comparable to B200 and a bit of B200.
242 | 
243 | And we're aiming to have that in production at the end of next year and scale production in '26. So it just seems like if you've got autonomous vehicles that are operating for 50 or 60 hours a week, there's 168 hours in a week. So we have somewhere above, I think, 100 neural net computing. I think we need a better word than GPU because GPU means graphics processing unit.
244 | 
245 | So there's a 100 hours plus per week of AI compute, AI first compute from the fleet in the vehicles and probably some percentage from humanoid robots. That it would make sense to do distributed inference. And if there's a fleet of at some point, 100 million vehicles with AI5 and beyond, AI6 and 7 and what not and there are maybe billions of humanoid robots. That is just a staggering amount of inference compute that could be used for general purpose computing.
246 | 
247 | Doesn't have to use it for the humanoid robot or for the car. So I think that's a pretty obvious thing to say like, well, it's more useful than having to do nothing.
248 | 
249 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
250 | 
251 | All right. Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper. Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
252 | 
253 | Alexander Potter -- Analyst
254 | 
255 | Perfect. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing. You mentioned that in passing previously.
256 | 
257 | I was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that would work? I guess, presumably, this would not be some sort of simple plug-and-play proposition that presumably an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on FSD. I imagine they would need to adopt Tesla's electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack. So correct me if I'm sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you'd be able to recognize licensing revenue from that agreement. Is that the right way to think about that?
258 | 
259 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
260 | 
261 | Yeah. The OEMs do not move fast. That's not really a sensor suite. It's just cameras, but they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a 360-degree view.
262 | 
263 | And at least the gateway like the -- what talks through the Internet and communicates with the Tesla system. With that you need kind of a gateway computer too. So it's really a gateway computer with cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, the Tesla AI computer and seven cameras or enough to get a 360-degree view. But this will -- given the speed at which the auto industry moves, it would be several years before you would see this in volume.
264 | 
265 | Alexander Potter -- Analyst
266 | 
267 | OK. Good. That's more or less what I expected. So then the follow-up here is, if you did sign an FSD licensing agreement with another automaker, when do you think you would disclose that? Would you do it right when you sign the agreement or only after that multiple years have passed and the vehicle is ready to be rolled out?
268 | 
269 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
270 | 
271 | I think it depends on the OEM. I guess we'd be happy either way.
272 | 
273 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
274 | 
275 | Yeah. It depends on what kind of arrangement we enter into. A lot of those things are, we've not got the end result yet. So we'll make that determination as and when we get to that point.
276 | 
277 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
278 | 
279 | And the kind of deals that are obviously relevant are only some OEMs willing to do this in 1 million cars a year or something significant. Because not if it's like 10,000 or 100,000 cars a year. We can just make that ourselves.
280 | 
281 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
282 | 
283 | All right. Thank you. The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
284 | 
285 | Dan Levy -- Analyst
286 | 
287 | Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I wanted to start with a question on Shanghai.
288 | 
289 | You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due to its low cost, that makes sense. Maybe you can just give us a sense of how the strategy changes, if at all, given the implementation of tariffs in Europe? Also to what extent your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs?
290 | 
291 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
292 | 
293 | Yeah. I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks. But just to give you a little bit more. Just on the tariff side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in their first round to establish the tariffs for cars being imported from China into Europe.
294 | 
295 | While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second round. They visited our factory. We worked with them, provided them all the information. As a result, we are adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe.
296 | 
297 | But -- and one other thing to note is, in Q2 itself, we started building right hand Model Ys out of Berlin and we also delivered it in the U.K. And we're adjusting as needed, but we will keep -- we're still importing Model 3s into Europe out of Shanghai. And we are still evaluating what is the best alternate way to manage all this. Just on the examination by the European authorities, like I said, we cooperated with them well.
298 | 
299 | We are confident that we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now, but this is literally evolving and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this. It is -- I would also add that because of this, you've seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into places like Taiwan, as well as the U.K., I just mentioned. So it will keep changing, and we will keep adapting as we go about it.
300 | 
301 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
302 | 
303 | Great.
304 | 
305 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
306 | 
307 | Thank you.
308 | 
309 | Dan Levy -- Analyst
310 | 
311 | Yeah. Thank you. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the Robotaxi strategy. And specifically, the shareholder deck here notes that the release is going to be -- one of the gating factors is regulatory approval.
312 | 
313 | So maybe you could help us understand which regulations specifically are the ones that we should be looking for? Is it FMVSS that's standard? And then to what extent does the strategy shift? You've done with FSD more of a nationwide, no boundary approach. Is the Robotaxi approach one that's more geo-fenced, so to speak, and is more driven by a state-by-state approach?
314 | 
315 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
316 | 
317 | I mean our solution is a generalized solution like what everybody else has. You could see if Waymo has one of it, they have very localized solution that requires high-density mapping. It's not -- it's quite fragile. So their ability to expand, I believe, is limited.
318 | 
319 | Our solution is a general solution that works anywhere. It would even work on a different earth. So if you branded a new earth, it would work on new earth. So it's this capability.
320 | 
321 | I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human, we find that regulators are supportive of deployment of that capability. It's difficult to argue with -- if you have got a large number of -- if you've got billions of miles that show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human, what regulator could really stand in the way of that. They're morally obligated to approve. So I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor.
322 | 
323 | I should also say that the self-driving capabilities that are deployed outside of North America are far behind that in North America. So with Version 12.5, and maybe 12.6, but pretty soon, we will ask for regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China and other countries. And I think we're likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in those regions obviously.
324 | 
325 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
326 | 
327 | Thank you.
328 | 
329 | Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst
330 | 
331 | Just to highlight that Travis. In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is the same across all 50 states. The road rules are the same across all 50 states. So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all 50 states reasonably.
332 | 
333 | Of course, there are state and even local municipal-level regulations that may apply to being a transportation company or deploying taxis. But as far as getting the vehicle on the road, that's all federal and that's very much in line with what Elon was suggesting of the data and the vehicle itself.

337 | And to add to the technology point, the end-to-end network basically makes no assumption about the location. Like you could add data from different countries and it just like performs equally well there. That's like almost close to zero, U.S.-specific code in there. It's all just the data that comes from the U.S.
338 | 
339 | Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst
340 | 
341 | Yes. To that end, Ashok, it's like we can go as humans to other countries and drive with some reasonable amount of assessment in those countries, and that's how you design the FSD software.
342 | 
343 | Ashok Elluswamy -- Director, Autopilot Software
344 | 
345 | Yes, exactly.
346 | 
347 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
348 | 
349 | Great. Thanks, guys. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
350 | 
351 | George Gianarikas -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst
352 | 
353 | Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second. And I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal-less, wheel-less vehicle, and according to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory environment.
354 | 
355 | And from what we understand, and again, maybe I'm wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown, at least in the images to the public is also pedal-less and wheel-less. Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that, that doesn't have pedal -- pedals or a wheel and that -- may that be different from just regular FSD on the traditional Tesla vehicle.
356 | 
357 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
358 | 
359 | Well, obviously, the real reason that they canceled it because GM can't make it work, not because of regulators, they're blaming regulators. That's misleading of them] to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets. So it's just that their technology is not at par.
360 | 
361 | George Gianarikas -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst
362 | 
363 | And maybe just as a follow-up, I think, you mentioned that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the price. Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means exactly?
364 | 
365 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
366 | 
367 | Yeah. We've shared that how -- that we've seen a meaningful increase. I don't want to get into specifics because we started from a low base, but we are seeing encouraging results. And the key thing here is, like Elon said, we need to experience it because words can't describe it till the time we actually use it.
368 | 
369 | And that's why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how this thing is working. Because when you see it working, you realize how great it is. I mean, just to give you one example. So again, this is a biased example, but I have more than 20-mile commute into the factory almost every day.
370 | 
371 | I have zero interventions on the latest version, and the car just literally drives me over. And especially with the latest version wherein we're also tracking your eye movement, the steering wheel lag is almost not there as long as you are not wearing sunglasses.
372 | 
373 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
374 | 
375 | We're fixing the sunglasses thing. It's coming soon. So you will be able to drive -- you'll be able to have sunglasses on and have the car drive. So -- but there's number of times I've talked with smart people who like live in New York or maybe downtown Boston and don't ever drive and then ask me about FSD, I'm like, you can just get a car and try it.
376 | 
377 | And if you're not doing that, you have no idea what's going on.
378 | 
379 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
380 | 
381 | The next question comes from Pierre from New Street. Pierre, please unmute yourself.
382 | 
383 | Pierre Ferragu -- Analyst
384 | 
385 | Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So it's on Robotaxi, again, and I completely get it that with a universal solution we will get like regulatory approval. We get there eventually clicking up miles and compute, etc.
386 | 
387 | And my question is more how you think about deployment? Because I'm still like -- I'm thinking once you have a car that can drive everywhere that can replace me, it can replace a taxi. But then to do the ride-hailing service, you need a certain scale. And that means a lot of cars on the road. And so you need an infrastructure to just maintain the cars, take care of them, etc.
388 | 
389 | And so my question is, are you already working on that? Do you have already an idea of what like your plan to deploy looks like? And is that like a Tesla-only plan? Or are you looking at partners, local partners, global partners to do that? And then I have a quick follow-up.
390 | 
391 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
392 | 
393 | This would just be the Tesla network. You just literally open the Tesla app and summon a car and we send a car to pick you up and take you somewhere. And our -- we will have a fleet that's on the order of 7 million vehicle autonomy soon. In the U.S.
394 | 
395 | it will be over 10 million and over 20 million. This is in that scale. And the car is able to operate 24/7 unlike the human drivers. So the capability to -- like this basically instant scale with a software update.
396 | 
397 | And now this is for a customer-owned fleet. So you can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb, like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet or cancel that and bring it back. It will be used by the fleet all the time, can be used by the fleet some of the time and then Tesla will take a share in the revenue with the customer. If you can think of the driving fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet -- Airbnb on wheels.
398 | 
399 | I mean in addition, we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be added to the fleet. I guess that would be a bit more like Uber. But this will all be a Tesla network. And there's an important clause we've put in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be used in the Tesla fleet.
400 | 
401 | They cannot be used by a third party for autonomy.
402 | 
403 | Pierre Ferragu -- Analyst
404 | 
405 | OK. And do you think that scales like progressively, so you can start in a city with just a handful of cars. Then you grow the number of cars over time? Or do you think there is like a critical mass you need to get to, to be able to offer like a service that is of competitive quality compared to what like Uber would be typically delivering already?
406 | 
407 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
408 | 
409 | I guess, I'm not conveying this correctly. The entire Tesla fleet basically becomes active. This is obviously -- maybe there's some number of people who don't want their car to earn money. But I think most people will.
410 | 
411 | It's instant scale.
412 | 
413 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
414 | 
415 | Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin from Oppenheimer. Colin, please unmute yourself.
416 | 
417 | Colin Rusch -- Analyst
418 | 
419 | Sorry about that, guys. I've got two questions around energy storage. With the tight supply in the stationary storage, can you talk about your pricing strategy? And how you're thinking about saturation in given geographies given that some of these larger systems are starting to shift wholesale power markets in a pretty meaningful way quickly.
420 | 
421 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
422 | 
423 | So yes, I mean, we are working with a large set of players in the market and our pipeline is actually pretty long. And there is actually a very -- there's actually a long end in terms of where you enter into a contract to where delivery starts happening. And so far, we have good pricing leverage, and I'll Mike chime in on this, too.
424 | 
425 | Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst
426 | 
427 | Yes. I mean there's a lot of competition from Chinese OEMs, just like there is in the vehicle space. So we're in close contact with our customers and making sure that we're remaining competitive in where they're needing to be competitive to secure contracts to sell power and energy in the markets. We had a really strong contracting quarter and continue to build our backlog for 2025 and 2026.
428 | 
429 | So we feel pretty good about where we are in the market. We realize that competition is strong, but we have a pretty strong value proposition with offering a fully integrated product with our own power electronics and site level control so --
430 | 
431 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
432 | 
433 | Yes. And again, the aspect which people do not fully understand is that there's also a whole software stack which comes with Megapack. And that is a unique proposition, which we have -- which is only available to us, and we're using it with other stuff, too, but that gives us a much more of an edge as compared to the competition.
434 | 
435 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
436 | 
437 | Yes, we find customers that they can sort of put together a hodgepodge solution and then sometimes they'll pick their solutions. And then that doesn't work, and then they come back to us.
438 | 
439 | Unknown speaker -- -- Analyst
440 | 
441 | Yes. And we're not really seeing saturation like on a global scale. There's little pockets of saturation in different markets, but we're more seeing that there's markets opening up given demand on the grid just continues to increase more than anyone expects. So that just opens up markets really across the world in different pockets.
442 | 
443 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
444 | 
445 | Yes. I mean just even on the AI compute side, these GPUs are really powerful. And the amount of new pipeline, which we're getting for people, for data center backup and things like that is increasing at a pretty large scale.
446 | 
447 | Colin Rusch -- Analyst
448 | 
449 | And then the follow up there is on rollout of 4680 process technology in the roll-to-roll process, there's some news around your equipment suppliers. Can you talk about how far along you were in potentially qualifying an incremental supplier around some of those critical process technology steps?
450 | 
451 | Lars Moravy -- Vice President, Vehicle Engineering
452 | 
453 | Yes, I can talk about that. You're probably referring to the lawsuit that we have with 1 of our suppliers. Look, I don't think this is going to affect our ability to roll out 4680. We have very strong IP position in the technology.
454 | 
455 | And the majority of the equipment that we use is in-house designed and some of it is in-house build. And so we can take our IP stack and have someone else build it if we need to. So that's not really a concern right now.
456 | 
457 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
458 | 
459 | Yes. I think people don't understand just how much demand there will be for storage. They really just -- like the people, I think, are underestimating this demand by product order of magnitude. So the actual energy -- total energy output of say, the U.S.
460 | 
461 | grid is, if the power plants can operate at steady state is at least two to three times the amount of energy it currently produces. Because there are huge gaps -- because there's a huge difference in the -- from peak to trough in terms of energy or power generation. So in order for a grid to not have blackouts, it must be able to support the load at the worst minute of the worst day of the year. The coldest or hottest day, which means that for the rest of the time -- the rest of the year, it's got massive excess power generation capability, but it has no way to store that energy.
462 | 
463 | Once you add battery packs, you can now run the power plants at steady state. Steady state means that basically any given grid anywhere in the world can produce in terms of cumulative energy in the course of the year, at least twice what it is currently producing, in some cases, maybe three times.
464 | 
465 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
466 | 
467 | All right. Thank you.
468 | 
469 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
470 | 
471 | That's a very profound thing.
472 | 
473 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
474 | 
475 | Great. Thank you, Elon. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, please unmute yourself.
476 | 
477 | Colin Langan -- Analyst
478 | 
479 | Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Do you hear me? I guess, I guess, when you ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut. I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn't survive on EV subsidies.
480 | 
481 | But when Tesla loses a lot of support, IRA goes away, I think Model 3 and Y get IRA help for customers and I think your batteries get production tax credits. So just one, can you clarify if the IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near term? Why might it not be a negative? And then any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related.
482 | 
483 | Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect
484 | 
485 | I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly. But long term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess, yes. But as I said this before in earning calls, it -- the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are, I think, no way it's relative to autonomy.
486 | 
487 | So I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla would solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. If you believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are in the noise.
488 | 
489 | Vaibhav Taneja -- Chief Financial Officer
490 | 
491 | Yes. I mean I'll add this just to clarify a few things that -- at the end of the day, when we are looking at our business, we've always been looking at it whether or not IRA is there. And we want our business to grow healthy without having any subsidies coming in, whichever way you look at it. And that's the way we've always modeled everything.
492 | 
493 | And that is the way internally, also even when we're looking at battery costs, yes, IRA, there are manufacturing credits which we get, but we always drive ourselves to say, OK, what if there is no IRA benefit? And how do we operate in that kind of an environment? Like Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to our competition on that front. We've delivered it and you can see it in the numbers over the years. So there is -- you cannot ignore the fundamental sides of the business. And then on top of it, once you add autonomy to it, like Elon said, it becomes meaningless to even think about the short term.
494 | 
495 | Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations
496 | 
497 | OK. I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.
498 | 
499 | Thank you very much, and goodbye.
