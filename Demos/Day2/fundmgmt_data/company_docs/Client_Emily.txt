Emily Davis, a 50-year-old accountant with a moderate risk tolerance, prioritizes income generation and capital preservation. Her portfolio, managed by Rebecca L., is invested in tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet. To ensure a steady income stream, Rebecca is required to prioritize stocks with strong dividend yields and a history of increasing dividend payments. Additionally, she must implement strategies to protect the portfolio from market volatility, such as diversification and hedging. Emily is cautious about investing in new and emerging themes, preferring a more conservative approach. She has expressed concerns about the potential risks associated with speculative investments. However, she is open to considering new themes if they align with her long-term investment goals and risk tolerance.

Emily has a strong preference for blue-chip stocks with a proven track record of performance. She is also interested in investing in dividend-paying stocks to generate income. However, she is not willing to sacrifice safety for yield. As such, Rebecca must carefully select investments that meet Emily's specific needs and risk tolerance.

She is invested in Microsoft and Alphabet for their strong financial performance and dividend yields and believe they are well placed for the new AI technologies. She is also invested in Tesla for its electric vehicles and disruptive innovations, however the investment size is small due to the rising competition.
