He seeks long-term growth and capital appreciation from his investments. His portfolio, managed by Harry S., is heavily invested in tech giants Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla. To maximize the potential of AI, Harry is tasked with allocating at least 40% of the portfolio to AI-related companies and technologies. Past discussions with Alex have revealed his keen interest in quantum computing and blockchain technology. While he is open to new themes, he prefers a focused approach, concentrating on core technologies that have the potential to disrupt industries. The manager will actively monitor the portfolio and rebalance as needed to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate risks.; Alex has expressed a strong desire to invest in companies that are at the forefront of technological innovation. He is particularly interested in companies that are developing cutting-edge products and services, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. However, he is also aware of the risks associated with investing in emerging technologies. As such, he has instructed Harry to conduct thorough due diligence on all potential investments and to diversify the portfolio to mitigate risk. He is currently invested in Microsoft for it AI and Cloud services and Alphabet for its hardware, search and competitive cloud services.; Mark Mahaney (Evercore): Okay. I would like to ask two questions, please, to Anat. First, the margins at Cloud really started to ramp nicely. There are comps in the industry with still materially higher operating margins, I imagine that's a matter of scale and trying to catch up from a third-place position, but how do you think about the margin trends that you're seeing? And what's your level of confidence that those margins can kind of match up to other industry players that are doing closer to 30% margins?; Next, Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with our growth. This business has real momentum, and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace GenAI. We generated Q3 revenues of $11.4 billion, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. Our technology leadership and AI portfolio are helping us attract new customers, win larger deals, and drive 30% deeper product adoption with existing customers.; Certainly, very pleased to see not just the top-line growth rate, but the margin expansion to 17%. Really outstanding work by our Cloud team to drive continued benefit to customers. And as you think about that margin expansion, really, it's a few things. You've mentioned one of them. The first is scale. Obviously, as we scale the business, we have more opportunity for margin expansion. But the second, and it shouldn't be underestimated, is the work that the team has done to drive efficiencies across the Cloud business. And we're seeing those come through, whether it's through headcount management, facilities management, other process efficiencies. We're seeing that go to the bottom line and driving the results you're seeing this quarter. Hard to obviously compare to any of our peers or competitors. It's a different business. But more to come. Now, the one thing to remember, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, this is an area that requires investment. And a lot of this investments, if you think about servers, et cetera, is based on demand we're seeing from customers. So this will translate to revenue in the fairly short term. But that means there are headwinds associated with overall the annual run rate or costs associated with these investments, whether it's in the form of depreciation or just construction costs that are not capitalized, et cetera."}

Microsoft is aggressively investing in AI hardware to support its Azure cloud services. This strategy has multiple facets: 1. Diverse AI Accelerators: Microsoft offers a wide range of AI accelerators from NVIDIA and AMD, acknowledging the importance of having the right hardware for different AI tasks. 2. First-Party Silicon (Azure Maia): Microsoft is developing its own AI chips, indicating a long-term commitment to optimizing its cloud infrastructure for AI workloads and potentially reducing reliance on third-party vendors. 3. Increased GPU Capacity and Utilization: Microsoft is actively increasing its GPU capacity to meet the surging demand for AI services and is seeing better-than-expected GPU utilization, which is driving revenue growth. This aggressive investment in AI infrastructure, combined with Microsoft's growing AI services offerings, strengthens Azure's position in the cloud market and aligns perfectly with Harry's focus on AI and high-growth potential companies.

Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia.; Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI services. While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business.; I wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're obviously guiding to a 1 to 2 point decel in December, and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the second half of your fiscal year, if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued core ex-AI Azure spend optimization continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative, but I'd just love to understand it. Thanks so much.; AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. A couple things, as I talked about Q2, and then in into H2. We've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers, are they going to continue to do that? It's an important part of running workloads. That is not new. There, obviously, were some quarters where it was more accelerated, but that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities. And so, I think that impact remains through the rest of the year, and my view is unchanged on that. And then, of course, I think the key component has always been new workloads start. And at the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts. And primarily, we're expecting those to come from AI workloads, but AI workloads don't just use our AI services. They use data services, and they use other things. And so, that combination, I think, looking on a competitive basis, we feel good about our execution. We feel good about taking share, and we feel good about consistent trends. And so, I feel good about that guide and what it says about where we are on share."}
{"query":"What are the updates on Tesla Optimus, should Emily invest in this new theme based on safety of such products?", "ground_truth":"Updates on Tesla's Optimus project indicate it is progressing rapidly, with the potential for limited production and use within Tesla factories by the end of this year, and potential external sales by the end of next year. Elon Musk believes Optimus has the potential to be incredibly valuable, exceeding all other Tesla products combined. However, these are estimates and subject to change as it is a new product. Regarding Emily's investment, the information provided strongly suggests against investing in Optimus based on her investment profile and concerns. Several factors point to this: 1. Emily prioritizes safety and capital preservation: Optimus is an extremely new and unproven technology with significant uncertainty regarding timelines and actual capabilities. Investing at this stage is highly speculative. Musk himself emphasizes the 'brand-new' nature and the 'uncharted territory' surrounding the project. 1. Emily prefers established, dividend-paying stocks: Optimus is not a revenue-generating product currently, and any potential returns are far in the future and highly uncertain. There's no dividend associated with this type of investment. 2. Emily is cautious about new and emerging themes: She prefers a conservative approach and is wary of speculative investments. Optimus, given its current stage of development, falls squarely into the category of a speculative investment. While she has a small investment in Tesla already, it's due to its established EV business, not for speculative ventures like Optimus. While Tesla is working on safety measures, including localized shut-off capabilities to prevent malware uploads, the long-term safety and ethical implications of widespread humanoid robot deployment remain unknown and could present considerable risks.

The next question from Siddharth: What is the timeline for Optimus first production of -- volume production line? And what are the barriers to getting there?; You know, Optimus obviously is a -- is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product. It's something that I think has the potential to -- the potential to far exceed the value of -- of everything else that Tesla combined. And when you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita. But what if there's no limit to capita? There's no limit to the economy. And -- and the technologies that -- the AI technologies were developed for the car translate quite well to a humanoid robot because the car is just a robot on four wheels. You know, Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world; it's just a four-wheeled robot. So, Optimus is a, you know, robot with a -- humanoid robot with arms and legs. It's by far the most sophisticated humanoid robot that's being developed anywhere in the world. I think we've got a good chance of shipping some number of Optimus units next year. But like I said, this -- this is a brand-new product. A lot of uncertainty is -- when you have -- when there's a lot of uncertainty and you're in uncharted territory, it's obviously impossible to make a precise prediction. But we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus, you know, every few months. And you can see that it's advancing very quickly. I was just in the Optimus lab, actually, until late last night. It's like midnight or something if I left the Optimus lab. The team is doing amazing work. You know, that's obviously a case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe, especially at scale and that there's no -- it should be impossible for any centralized control to upload malware to a humanoid robot. So, we're going to want to, well, then localize shut-off that cannot be updated from the -- from -- from a central server. That -- that's the case where we really have to give extreme thought to safety. But, like I said, I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable -- most valuable product of any kind ever, by far.; Martin Viecha Thank you. The second question is on Optimus. So, what is the current status of Optimus? Are they currently performing any factory tasks? When do you expect to start mass production?; Elon Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab. We do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year. And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year. These are just guesses. As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined. Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy. So, that's what's going to happen. And I think Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with efficient inference on the robot itself. I mean, this, perhaps, is a point that is worth emphasizing Tesla's AI inference efficiency is vastly better than any other company. There's no company even close to the inference efficiency of Tesla. We've had to do that because we were constrained by the inference hardware in the car. We didn't have a choice. But that will pay dividends in many ways.; With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory. And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 and limited production starting early next year.; With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory. And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 and limited production starting early next year. This will be for Tesla consumption. It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves. But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories. And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit. And at that point, we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers. That will be a production Version 2 of Optimus. For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else. This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained.; Travis Axelrod -- Head of Investor Relations Great. The next question is, what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?; Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect There's -- Optimus is intended to be a generalized humanoid robot with a lot of intelligence. So it's like saying what kind of accessories will be offered by the human. It's just the intent to be able to be backward compatible with human tasks. So it would use any accessories that a human would use.; Ben Kallo -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term? And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue? And then my follow-up is just on the last call, you talked about distributing compute on your new hardware. Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the time line for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power in their cars?; Elon Reeve Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Yeah. I mean, as I have said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined. So it's simply just never considered the usefulness, utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you asked of it. I think everyone on earth is going to want one."}
