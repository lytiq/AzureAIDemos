      "Syndromic and familial forms, on the other hand, have complex patterns of \n",
      "inheritance and being reported as autosomal dominant, recessive and polygenic \n",
      "patterns of inheritance. The phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance \n",
      "observed in Hirschsprung's disease could also be explained by the involvement of \n",

      "phenotypic assessment of the disease has been complicated since a subset of the \n",

      "anomalies. Coding sequence mutations in e.g. RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 \n",
      "lead to long-segment (L-HSCR) as well as syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the \n",

      "and significantly so with length of aganglionosis (p = 7.6 x 10(-5)) and \n",
      "familiality (p = 6.2 x 10(-4)). The enhancer variant is more frequent in the \n",

      "rare, coding mutations are the norm in the less common and more severe forms of \n",
      "female, long-segment, and multiplex families. The T variant also increases \n",
      "penetrance in patients with rare RET coding mutations. Thus, both rare and \n",
      "common mutations, individually and together, make contributions to the risk of \n",
      "HSCR. The distribution of RET variants in diverse HSCR patients suggests a \n",
